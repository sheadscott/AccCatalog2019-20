		  <p>Thousands of Central Texas success stories begin right here. You can make your educational and career goals a reality, too. Austin Community College offers the support, resources, and affordable options to help you get anywhere you want to go.

		  </div><div id="how-to-use-this-catalog"><h1>How To Use This Catalog</h1><p>This catalog is a description of the academic programs, policies, and facilities of Austin Community College. It also describes the many resources we provide to assist you with achieving your academic and career goals, including free advising and tutoring services. At ACC you will have the opportunity to meet students and faculty with similar interests and to learn about how you can qualify for excellent jobs and careers or achieve transfer to a university.</p>
		  <p>ACC maintains an open-admissions policy providing higher education to all persons who can benefit from its programs and courses. Complete an ACC application at any time during the year and you will be admitted to the college. You should then attend an Area of Study (AoS) Information Session. There are ten broad Areas of Study. At the AoS Information session, you will learn more about the programs in that AoS as well as the career and transfer opportunities for which you will be prepared.</p>
		  <p>If you have a strong interest or passion in an Area of Study, you should pursue it. The three Areas of Study that currently provide the best career prospects in Central Texas are Computer and Information Technologies, Health Care, and the Skilled Trades/Advanced Manufacturing. Some Health Care programs such as nursing have competitive admissions and special prerequisites. You will learn about them at the Health Sciences Information Sessions. ACC has a Program Map for each program you might want to study. It will guide you to take the right courses in the right order. You will always have access to advisors and faculty members who can help you make good decisions for your future.</p>
		  <p>We look forward to serving you as an Austin Community College student!</p>

		  <h4><strong>Credit by Examination &ndash; Institutional Credit/Course Challenges</strong></h4>
		  <p>If you feel your background, education, and experience&nbsp;provide sufficient knowledge in a subject area, you can earn&nbsp;course credits through institutional credit by examination, or&nbsp;course challenges. Earning credit through challenge&nbsp;examinations is equivalent to passing a cumulative, end-of-the-term examination.</p>
		  <p>Below is a list of some instructional programs offering&nbsp;institutional course credit by examination, sorted by <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/academic-and-career-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Area of Study</a>. Note: not all courses in a program are necessarily eligible for Credit by Examination. Contact the <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/instructional-departments-and-divisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instructional department</a> directly to find out if credit by examination is an option for your major and for more details.</p>

		  <p>In addition to meeting with an advisor, ACC has many tools to assist you with your course selection and planning. Program Maps set up clear pathways for you to follow, based upon your Area of Study and selected program, if you have declared a major.</p>
		  <p>You will find these online at each Area of Study website. Visit <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/academic-and-career-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.austincc.edu/academic-and-career-programs</a> and select your path to find your program map.</p>
		  <p>ACC&rsquo;s Degree Map is another tool available to you to know which courses you should register for in your first semester.</p>
		  <p>Some students choose to attend full-time and some choose to attend part-time. A full-time schedule is considered twelve to fifteen credit hours per semester.</p>
		  <p>Note about auditing courses: Admitted students may audit classes if space permits. Audit registration is allowed only during the final day of schedule changes (add/drops). Tuition and fees for audited courses are the same as those for courses taken for credit. Dual credit students may not audit classes.</p>
		  <h4>Plan &amp; Register Using the Online Registration System</h4>
		  <p>You will use Self-Service Student Planning to plan and register for your classes. Self-Service allows you to view class availability in real time. Visit <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/students/registration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.austincc.edu/students/registration</a> for more information.</p>
		  <p>Registration is available on days listed in the academic calendar. ACC reserves the right to change registration dates. Check the ACC website for updated registration and payment information at <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/students/calendars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.austincc.edu/students/calendars</a>.</p>
		  <h4>Plan Ahead to Avoid Deregistration</h4>
		  <p>You are not officially registered until you pay your tuition in full (or have arranged a payment plan and made your first payment) and, if needed, meet the meningitis immunization requirement. If you do not meet these requirements before your tuition payment deadline, you will be deregistered (&ldquo;dropped&rdquo; from your classes). If you are deregistered, you are not guaranteed to receive your previous schedule if you&nbsp;re-register.</p>
		  <p>Take note of your tuition payment dates to ensure you are not deregistered. Tuition payment deadlines vary, depending on your date of registration or session. They are listed at <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/students/tuition-and-payments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.austincc.edu/tuition</a>.</p>
		  <h4>Student Holds</h4>
		  <p>A student hold may prevent you from registering for classes. Allow up to 24 hours for a student hold to be removed from your record after you have completed the requirement. Common student holds are listed at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.austincc.edu/students/registration/student-holds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.austincc.edu/students/registration/student-holds</a>.</p>

		  </div><div id="financial-aid"><h3>Financial Aid</h3><p>The Financial Aid Office administers financial assistance programs to benefit eligible students and families who are unable to afford the cost of a college education. Not all financial aid policies and procedures are listed in this catalog. Visit <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/students/financial-aid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.austincc.edu/students/financial-aid</a> for additional information, including how to apply, how to receive your funds, and rights and responsibilities.</p>
		  <h4><strong>Types of Aid</strong></h4>
		  <p>Financial aid comes in four types:</p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Grants</li>
		  <li>Loans</li>
		  <li>Work-study programs</li>
		  <li>Scholarships</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>These types may be combined in a financial aid package to help pay for educational expenses. Generally, scholarships and grants do not have to be repaid.</p>
		  <h4><strong>State and Federal Regulations</strong></h4>
		  <p>ACC complies with all state and federal regulations governing student financial aid programs. These policies can change unexpectedly in response to legislative action or U.S. Department of Education interpretation. In the event of changes after this catalog is published, the Financial Aid Office will comply with the most current regulations and interpretations.</p>
		  <h4><strong>Eligibility</strong></h4>
		  <p>To qualify for financial aid, you must:<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen.</li>
		  <li>Have a high school diploma or GED.</li>
		  <li class="li5">Enroll or be accepted at Austin Community College. Your ACC application must be on file.</li>
		  <li>Major in an eligible program of study and take eligible courses.</li>
		  <li>Meet Selective Service requirements, if applicable.</li>
		  <li>Not be in default on any federal student loan or owe a federal grant repayment.</li>
		  <li>Not be convicted for possession or sale of illegal drugs while receiving federal aid.</li>
		  <li>Meet FAFSA criteria for financial need (for most financial&nbsp;aid programs).</li>
		  <li>Maintain academic standards of progress for financial aid&nbsp;students.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>Some factors limit financial aid:</p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>If you received a full-time Pell Grant for more than six&nbsp;years, you are no longer eligible for this award.</li>
		  <li>If you have high student loan debt, you may be denied&nbsp;additional loans.</li>
		  <li>If you already have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, you must submit a&nbsp;maximum time frame appeal when applying for aid.</li>
		  <li>If you are a co-enrolled or summer transfer student,&nbsp;you must obtain financial aid from your home college&nbsp;or university. Contact your home institution to request&nbsp;a consortium agreement that allows you to apply your&nbsp;financial aid to ACC classes.</li>
		  <li>If you are a first-time borrower on or after July 1, 2013, there is a limit on the maximum period of time (measured in academic years) that you can receive Federal Direct Subsidized Loans.</li>
		  <li>The U.S. Department of Education established regulations to prevent fraud and abuse in the Federal Student Aid program by identifying students with unusual enrollment histories. Students who have been selected for unusual enrollment will have to appeal in order to be eligible for financial aid.</li>
		  <li>Further information regarding eligibility can be found on&nbsp;the ACC Financial Aid website at <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/students/financial-aid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.austincc.edu/students/financial-aid</a></li>
		  </ul>
		  <h4><strong>Priority Dates to Apply for Financial Aid</strong></h4>
		  <p>Because some types of funds are limited, we recommend you submit your financial aid application (FAFSA) by the priority dates. Students who submit their application after the priority dates are still eligible for financial aid but may need to pay their tuition before the payment due date.<strong><br>

		  <p>You must check your ACC email and/or ACC&rsquo;s Self-Service Financial Aid site for important deadlines.</p>
		  <h4><strong>Course Withdrawal and Financial Aid Repayment</strong></h4>
		  <p>You may be required to repay financial aid if you drop or withdraw from your classes. Check with the Financial Aid Office at any campus to determine your requirement for repayment.<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>If the withdrawal occurs before the first day of classes, you must repay all your financial aid.</li>
		  <li>If the withdrawal occurs on or after the first day of classes, the Financial Aid Office uses a federal formula to determine the amount of financial aid you must repay.</li>
		  <li>Within 45 days of the date you withdraw, you must repay the funds to ACC, which will return those funds to the federal aid programs from which they came.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p><strong>Official Withdrawal<br>
		  </strong>If you withdraw from all classes during a semester or session, the date you withdraw is your official withdrawal date unless documented otherwise. The official withdrawal date is used to determine if you may need to repay financial aid.<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <p><strong>Unofficial Withdrawal</strong><br>
		  Under federal regulations, students earning an unsatisfactory grades in all classes for a semester are considered unofficially withdrawn; unless they engaged in some academic activity beyond the 60 percent point of the semester. At ACC, unsatisfactory grades are F and I (Incomplete).</p>
		  <p>For any student for whom the last date of academic activity cannot be documented as occurring on or after the 60 percent point of semester, the withdrawal date will be considered the mid-point of the semester unless documented otherwise.</p>
		  <p>Any student who is considered an unofficial withdrawal and who has a required repayment will be responsible to repay those funds before receiving additional federal financial aid at ACC or any other institution.</p>
		  <h4><strong>Satisfactory Academic Progress</strong></h4>
		  <p>Federal regulations require students who receive financial aid to meet a set of standards identified for Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP).<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <p><strong>Determine Your Academic Progress<br>
		  </strong>Your Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) status is determined when you apply for financial aid. It is based on all previous academic history. Once you receive aid, your academic progress is evaluated at the end of every semester.<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <p>It is your responsibility to monitor your academic progress and meet with an advisor, completion counselor, or success coach before you encounter difficulties that threaten your financial aid eligibility. The ACC website provides online GPA calculators and course completion calculators to keep track of your academic progress.</p>

		  <p><strong>Re-establish Your Eligibility<br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <p>You can re-establish your financial aid eligibility by raising your GPA and completion rate to the minimum standards or, if appropriate, completing a Financial Aid SAP Appeal. Here are some examples of circumstances in which we encourage a Financial Aid SAP Appeal: illness, injury, death of a relative or close friend, divorce, loss of employment, childcare issues, transportation issues, or other unforeseen events.</p>
		  <p><strong>Financial Aid SAP Appeal</strong></p>
		  <p>The Financial Aid SAP Appeal allows the ACC Financial Aid Office to consider granting you aid while you work to get back to the minimum SAP requirements. You will gain access to the SAP Appeal Form after you pass the &ldquo;Key Components to SAP FA Appeal Process&rdquo; video series and quiz on&nbsp;GetSAP. Follow all instructions on the SAP Appeal Form, and submit the complete appeal to a campus Financial Aid Office.</p>
		  </div><div id="veterans-benefits"><h3>Veterans&rsquo; Benefits</h3><p>All of Austin Community College&rsquo;s associate degrees and credit-based career/technical programs are approved for veterans&rsquo; educational benefits (most non-credit Continuing Education programs are not approved). To receive veterans&rsquo; benefits, contact the Veterans Resource Center, adjacent to the Highland Campus, or a Veterans Affairs Office located at Cypress Creek, Northridge, Riverside, and Round Rock campuses.</p>
		  <p>All relevant documentation must be submitted and criteria met before certification for benefits will be processed. For more information, including locations and hours of the Veterans Affairs Offices, visit <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/students/veterans-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.austincc.edu/students/veterans-services</a>.</p>
		  <h4>Advance Payment for Tuition &amp; Fees</h4>
		  <p>Advance payment is intended to help eligible students meet school-related expenses that are concentrated at the beginning of the term. This program is not available to Chapter 33 students. Eligible advance pay recipients are still responsible for paying their tuition when it is due. The processing deadline date for advance pay requests is 30 days prior to the start of the term. Please contact a <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/students/veterans-services/on-campus-assistance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Veterans Affairs Office</a> regarding eligibility requirements and regulations.</p>
		  <h4>Certification of Veteran&rsquo;s Benefits</h4>
		  <p>The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) requires that each veteran receiving educational benefits follow an approved course of study that will lead to an approved degree or vocational objective. A veteran may not receive payment for courses previously completed, for courses that are in excess of degree or certificate requirements, or for courses that do not apply to an approved degree or certificate. Developmental education courses are eligible for certification if a need has been established based on assessment test results.</p>
		  <h4>Transcripts Evaluated for Credit</h4>
		  <p>All students receiving DVA educational benefits must submit official transcripts of all previous college education and/or vocational training to have those transcripts evaluated for credit. Veterans must also have their military training evaluated.</p>
		  <h4>Academic Standards for Receiving Veteran&rsquo;s Benefit</h4>
		  <p>Satisfactory academic progress (SAP) must be maintained. Enrollment does not guarantee eligibility for benefits. Check with a <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/students/veterans-services/on-campus-assistance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Veterans Affairs Office</a> for details about maintaining satisfactory progress.</p>
		  <h4>Support &amp; Services</h4>
		  <p>ACC&rsquo;s Veterans Affairs specialists are available to help you and your dependents enroll at ACC, pay for college, and receive support and services to meet your college goals.

		  <h4>Available Information</h4>
		  <p>Educational pamphlets on the subject of HIV/AIDS prevention are available in the Student Services Office and are provided to students upon request.

		  </div><div id="student-records"><h3>Student Records</h3><h4>Access to Student Records</h4>
		  <p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (PL93-380), commonly referred to as FERPA, provides that all records pertaining to a student that are maintained by the college must be open to inspection by the student and may not be made available to any other person without the written authorization of the student.</p>
		  <h4>Directory Information</h4>
		  <p>The release of information to the public without student consent will be limited to that designated as directory information. ACC has designated the following information as directory information:</p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Name, address, telephone number</li>
		  <li>ACC Student Email Address</li>
		  <li>Date and place of birth</li>
		  <li>Major field of study</li>
		  <li>Participation in activities</li>
		  <li>Dates of attendance</li>
		  <li>Degrees, certificates, and awards</li>
		  <li>Name of the previous educational institution attended</li>
		  <li>Student classification and enrollment status</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h4>Access to Directory Information</h4>
		  <p>Directory information is considered public record under the Texas Public Information Act and must be released to requestors unless you have submitted a written request to any campus Admissions and Records Office to make your directory information private.</p>
		  <p>To withhold your information, submit the Request to Withhold Directory Information form to any campus Admissions and Records Office within the first 12 days of the semester. Your request remains in effect until revoked by you in writing.</p>
		  <h4>Your Rights Under FERPA</h4>
		  <p>You have the right to inspect and review your student records maintained by the college. The college is not required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for eligible students to review the records. You may be charged a fee for copies.</p>
		  <p>You have the right to request that a school correct records that you believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If ACC decides not to amend the record, you have the right to a formal hearing.</p>
		  <p>After the hearing, if the college still decides not to amend the record, you have the right to place a statement with the record setting forth your view about the contested information.</p>
		  <p>Generally, the college must have written permission from you in order to release any information from your student record. However, FERPA allows the college to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions:</p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>School officials with legitimate educational interest</li>
		  <li>Other schools to which a student is transferring</li>
		  <li>Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes</li>
		  <li>Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student</li>
		  <li>Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school</li>
		  <li>Accrediting organizations</li>
		  <li>To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena</li>
		  <li>Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies</li>
		  <li>State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h4>Parent Rights Under FERPA</h4>
		  <p>FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children&rsquo;s student records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level.</p>
		  <h4>Definition of Student Record</h4>
		  <p>Student records at ACC include any information collected, assembled, or maintained by the college and its employees. Records may be in the form of documents, writings, letters, memoranda, computer tapes, audio or video recordings, text messages, and other forms of information that directly or indirectly contain the identity of the student.</p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>These include documents related to the following areas:</li>
		  <li>Admission applications</li>
		  <li>Financial aid documents</li>
		  <li>Veterans&rsquo; training reports</li>
		  <li>Standardized test scores</li>
		  <li>Specialized test scores</li>
		  <li>Family background information</li>
		  <li>Transcripts of grades</li>
		  <li>Directory information</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h4>Student Records Custodian</h4>

		  </div><div id="academic-planning"><h1>Academic Planning</h1><div id="areas-of-study"><h2>Areas of Study</h2><p>ACC offers 10 Areas of Study that unite degree- and certificate-seeking students based on their declared majors and areas of interest. Academic programs within each Area of Study share common transfer paths, career tracks, and ways of looking at the world. Visit <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/academic-and-career-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.austincc.edu/academic-and-career-programs</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>
		  <p>The Areas of Study are:</p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Arts, Digital Media, and Communication (ADMC)</li>
		  <li>Business (B)</li>
		  <li>Computer Science and Information Technology (CSIT)</li>
		  <li>Culinary, Hospitality and Tourism (CHT)</li>
		  <li>Design, Manufacturing, Construction, and Applied Technologies (DMCAT)</li>
		  <li>Education (E)</li>
		  <li>Health Sciences (HS)</li>
		  <li>Liberal Arts (LA)</li>
		  <li>Public and Social Services (PSS)</li>
		  <li>Science, Engineering, and Math (SEM)</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>Each Area of Study has degree and certificate plans, or pathways, designed to help you meet your academic and career goals by offering simplified, streamlined, and targeted course selection. The pathways are intended to help you register for the courses you need to stay on a path to completion and success. These Areas of Study pathways provide assigned advisors, academic support, career-related extracurricular activities, and engaging student life activities.</p>
		  <p>You must choose an Area of Study when you apply to ACC but you can change to another Area of Study if your interests or goals change. Your advisor can help you select the Area of Study and program that best meets your needs. You should choose an Area of Study and program that fits your transfer and career plans.</p>
		  <p>You must declare a major, or program of study, before the end of your first semester at ACC. If you are receiving Financial Aid, you must declare a major upon application to the college in order to receive your funds. To declare or change your major, make an appointment to see an Area of Study advisor.</p>
		  <h4>Possible Effect of Criminal Record</h4>
		  <p>When seeking to major in certain programs at ACC, your ability to complete the program, be licensed or certified, or be employed may be affected if you have a prior criminal record. In such cases, the actual violation and the length of time since that violation may be the deciding factor.</p>
		  <p>Programs that require agency sponsorship and programs that require practicums, internships, or clinical experience rely on community agencies to help students fulfill that requirement. Some of those agencies may require criminal background checks prior to your being allowed into their facilities. If the participating community agency will not accept you because of a criminal record, you may be unable to continue in the program.</p>
		  <p>Programs where a prior criminal record may come into question include, but are not limited to, Health Sciences, Criminal Justice, Education, and Child Development. You should check with the program to confirm your eligibility. The college conducts pre-employment criminal background checks on all otherwise eligible financial aid applicants for Work Study.</p>
		  <p>Applicants, such as registered sex offenders, should be aware that ACC is considered a &ldquo;place where minors gather for regularly scheduled educational programs and/or activities.&rdquo; In addition, some ACC campuses are in proximity to minors in public schools.</p>
		  <div id="programs-and-awards"><h3>Programs and Awards</h3><p>Austin Community College offers college-level awards in the form of degrees and certificates in a variety of programs.</p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Baccalaureate Degrees: require at least 120 semester credit hours (SCH) for completion. ACC currently only offers the RN to BSN (Bachelor of Science in Nursing), a degree completion program.</li>
		  <li>Associate Degrees: require at least 60 semester credit hours (SCH) and take approximately two years to complete if you attend full time. The following Associate of Applied Science programs are approved by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to exceed the 60 SCH: American Sign Language-Interpreter Training, Dental Hygiene, Diagnostic Cardiac Sonography, Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Physical Therapist Assistant, Radiology.</li>
		  <li>Certificates: require 15 SCH &ndash; 51 SCH and can be completed in as little as one semester.</li>
		  <li>Occupational Skills Awards: require 9 SCH &ndash; 14 SCH or 144 &ndash; 359 contact hours for workforce continuing education courses.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>In general, if you plan to transfer to a university to pursue a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, you should complete an Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degree. These degrees are broad and set you up for transferring to a university with junior (Year 3) status.</p>
		  <p>If you plan to enter the workforce as soon as possible, you would usually pursue an Associate of Applied Science degree or a Certificate. These are ordinarily focused on preparing you for a specific industry upon graduation.</p>

		  <p>The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree is specifically designed to prepare graduates of Associate Degree Nursing (ADN) and nursing diploma programs, who already hold a Registered Nursing (RN) license, with additional skills in management, leadership, theory, and research to succeed and be promoted within the nursing profession.</p>
		  <p>The Associate of Arts (AA) and Associate of Science (AS) degrees are specifically designed to allow for the transfer and application of credits earned at Austin Community College to the bachelor degree requirements of most public colleges and universities. In addition, completion of the Associate of Arts and Associate of Science degrees at ACC also guarantees completion of the state-mandated core curriculum and the acceptance in transfer of a minimum of 42-semester credit hours toward the general education requirements in a bachelor&rsquo;s degree at all state supported higher education institutions in Texas. The Associate of Science degree differs from the Associate of Arts degree primarily in the amount or level of mathematics required for degree completion so students will be prepared to transfer as a junior majoring in the sciences, math or engineering. Students seeking to transfer should consult with an Area of Study advisor or a program advisor to ensure that they enroll in those courses that will most smoothly transfer to their intended receiving institution, since different universities may have different requirements.</p>
		  <p>The&nbsp;Associate of Arts in Teaching (AAT) degree is designed to prepare students&nbsp;to transfer to a Texas public university as a junior with a specific teaching major: Early Childhood-Grade 6, Grades 4-8, or Grades 8-12. The Associate of Arts in Teaching degree is fully transferable to any public university in Texas.</p>
		  <p>The Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree, offered in technical programs, is designed to prepare students for&nbsp;immediate employment upon graduation. While this degree is not focused on transfer, ACC has formal agreements with partner universities that allow transferability of courses in some ACC programs. Within many of the technologies, short-term certificate programs, also preparation for employment, are offered which can be completed in less than two years. See the&nbsp;<em>Programs and Awards</em> section of this catalog for more information on award options.</p>

		  <h4>Z-Classes and Z-Degrees</h4>
		  <p>Austin Community College is working to lower costs for students. Many core courses have sections that are taught with openly-licensed high quality textbooks (known as Open Educational Resources) or other freely-available course materials that are accessible electronically on the first day of class. These textbooks and course materials do not cost students any money. These zero-cost textbook sections are known as Z-classes.</p>
		  <p>In addition to Z-classes, ACC offers two Z-Degrees: the Associate of Arts in General Studies and the Associate of Science in General Studies. A Z-Degree is a degree that a student can complete entirely with Z-classes. Please note: Not every core curriculum course offers Z-classes. Not every campus offers Z-classes. Consult with the <a href="http://sites.austincc.edu/gest-sdev/about-general-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General Studies program advisor</a> to map your Z-Degree pathway in General Studies.</p>
		  <h4>Program Maps</h4>
		  <p>Austin Community College offers 10 <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/academic-and-career-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Areas of Study</a>, making it simple to plan and follow a guided pathway to your academic and career success. Over 100 programs&rsquo; award plans in these 10 areas lead to college credentials that include technical certificates, two-year associate degrees, and advanced technical awards.</p>
		  <p>Program maps are students guided pathways to academic and career success. They are designed to assist you with persisting at ACC through graduation and prepare you for employment, career advancement, or university transfer. See <a href="https://www6.austincc.edu/cms/site/www/catalog/programmaps/programmap.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Online Program Maps</a> for a current list of program maps within each Area of Study.</p>
		  <p><em>Please always check online at <a href="http://catalog.austincc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">catalog.austincc.edu</a> or meet with your <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/students/advising/areas-of-study-advising" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Area of Study advisor</a> or <a href="http://www.austincc.edu/instructional-departments-and-divisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instructional department</a>&rsquo;s program advisor to ensure that you are viewing the latest and most accurate information.</em></p>
		  </div><div id="course-descriptions-information"><h2>Course Descriptions Information</h2><h4><strong>Course Numbering System</strong></h4>
		  <p>Austin Community College has adopted the Texas Common Course Number system, which facilitates the identification of courses that transfer among public institutions. Disciplines identify courses using a four-letter rubric and a four-character number (e.g. ENGL 1301).</p>
		  <p>Under the common course numbering system, the first digit indicates the level at which the course is taught (e.g. 1=freshman, 2=sophomore). The second number indicates credit-hour value and the third and fourth numbers indicate sequence of the course. Developmental courses, which are not transferable and therefore not part of the Texas Common Course Number system, have nevertheless adopted a four-character rubric.</p>
		  <p>The three figures in parentheses after the title of each course in&nbsp;the course descriptions listing indicate the number of semester&nbsp;credit hours for the course, the number of lecture hours each&nbsp;week and the number of laboratory or activity hours each week,&nbsp;respectively.</p>
		  <h4><strong>Course Entry Requirements</strong></h4>
		  <p>Most college-credit courses have one or more skill requirements in reading, writing, or mathematics. (For example, English Composition I requires proficiency in reading and writing.) Proficiency is determined by state-required Texas Success Initiative (TSI) assessment test to determine college-readiness in reading, writing, and math. Proficiency (or exemption) may also be proved with an official transcript from another college. Students must meet proficiency (or exemption) requirements of all courses. Applicable skills requirements are indicated in the course descriptions. A legend of skills requirements is provided below.</p>
		  <p>Skills Requirement(s) Legend</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 40px"><strong>A :</strong> Reading and Special Approval<br>
		  <strong>B :</strong> Reading and Math<br>
		  <strong>D :</strong> Reading, Math, and Special Approval<br>

		  <h4><strong>Allied Health Sciences</strong></h4>
		  <p>In the health sciences areas, more complete or in-depth course&nbsp;descriptions are available from the individual programs.</p>
		  <p>The Allied Health Sciences (ALHS) program is dedicated to educational excellence. To that end, every effort has been made to develop and offer a diverse range of courses (HPRS) designed to meet student needs and facilitate student success. ALHS is an interdisciplinary program in health sciences whose main responsibility is providing prerequisite and corequisite courses for other Health Science degrees and certificate programs.</p>
		  <p>Additionally, the Allied Health Sciences Department participates in First Day Access, (FDA), Supplemental Instruction(SI), and the Health Science Academy (HSA) to meet the college&rsquo;s mission, and to enhance student success. Every attempt, including technology based learning is used to enhance and strengthen the student&rsquo;s education experiences.</p>
		  <p>A variety of courses in allied health specialties are offered for students who are: (1) seeking enrollment in ACC health science programs such as nursing, surgical and medical laboratory technology, emergency medical services (paramedicine), physical therapy, and pharmacy technician and several other health science programs; (2) co-enrolled in ACC health science programs; (3) transferring into health science programs at other institutions; (4) exploring health science careers; or (5) co-enrolled in public schools and either investigating health careers or planning to continue at ACC in a health science program. Courses are in medical terminology, pharmacology, pathophysiology, and end of life issues.

		  </div><div id="field-of-study"><h3>Field of Study</h3><p>Senate Bill 148 of the 75th Texas Legislature (1997) mandated field of study curricula. The field of study curriculum, along with core curriculum, is intended to facilitate course transfers among Texas public colleges and universities.</p>
		  <p>All public four-year institutions must accept state-approved field of study courses to fulfill lower-division requirements for bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in majors that correspond to that field of study. If a student takes all the courses in a field of study and then transfers to another Texas public institution of higher education, the field of study is guaranteed to transfer as a block and be applied to the appropriate major. <strong>Fields of study are valid only when no substitutions are made</strong>. If a student completes only part of the field of study, then credit for those courses that are successfully completed must apply toward the major.</p>
		  <p>Students should always consult with an academic or faculty advisor before pursuing any field of study. In addition, students should consult with an advisor at the Texas college or university to which they are transferring for additional information.</p>
		  <h4>Architecture Field of Study</h4>
		  <p>This field of study curriculum is designed for students seeking a bachelor&rsquo;s degree with a major in architecture.</p>
		  <p>ACC&rsquo;s field of study courses for architecture are listed below. The Field of Study Curriculum for Architecture consists of 36 lower-division semester credit hours that are fully transferable. Academic credit shall be granted on a course-for-course basis at the credit-hour level of the receiving institution. Full academic credit shall be granted on the basis of comparable courses completed, not on specific numbers of credit hours accrued. Courses are intended to fulfill all or part of various National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). Note that two of the courses in this Field of Study are not offered by ACC.</p>

		  <h4>Music Field of Study</h4>
		  <p>This field of study curriculum is designed for students seeking a bachelor&rsquo;s degree with a major in music or a related discipline.</p>
		  <p>Keyboard (piano) proficiency is a requirement for most baccalaureate degrees in music. Instruction in keyboard skills is generally offered in the first two years of undergraduate study. Keyboard proficiency courses approved for transfer are courses in group piano or applied piano lessons that concentrate specifically on the development of skills for passing keyboard proficiency examinations. Keyboard courses that concentrate primarily on performance literature are not considered keyboard proficiency courses. Completion of courses leading to keyboard proficiency does not necessarily satisfy the requirement at a receiving institution.</p>
		  <p>Transferring students who have completed the Field of Study Curriculum for Music must satisfy competency and proficiency requirements of the receiving institution. Diagnostic assessment of transfer students is permissible only if the receiving institution routinely conducts diagnostic assessment of its native students at the same point in the program of study. Should a transferring student fail to demonstrate proficiency, the student may be encouraged, but not required, to retake relevant courses to gain proficiency.</p>
		  <p>ACC&rsquo;s field of study courses for music are listed below. The Field of Study Curriculum for Music consists of 31 semester credit hours (SCH) of lower-division courses broken out by categories. These courses are transferable to other Texas public colleges and universities and are applicable to a bachelor&rsquo;s degree with a major in Music.</p>

		  </div></div><div id="experiential-learning"><h2>Experiential Learning</h2><p>Experiential learning is a process through which students develop knowledge, skills, and values from direct experiences outside a traditional academic setting. Experiential learning encompasses a variety of activities including internships, service learning, undergraduate research, study abroad, and other creative and professional work experiences. Well- planned, supervised and assessed experiential learning programs can stimulate academic inquiry by promoting interdisciplinary learning, civic engagement, career development, cultural awareness, leadership, and other professional and intellectual skills.</p>
		  <p>Learning that is considered &ldquo;experiential&rdquo; contain all the following elements:</p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Reflection, critical analysis and synthesis</li>
		  <li>Opportunities for students to take initiative, make decisions, and be accountable for the results</li>
		  <li>Opportunities for students to engage intellectually, creatively, emotionally, socially, or physically</li>
		  <li>A designed learning experience that includes the possibility to learn from natural consequences, mistakes, and successes</li>
		  </ul>
		  <div id="service-learning"><h3>Service Learning</h3><p>Service learning provides opportunities for you to apply what you learn in your academic coursework to a service opportunity in the community. To qualify as service learning, volunteer activities must challenge you to apply your academic knowledge and skills to meet community needs while you reflect upon and integrate your community experience to your coursework.</p>
		  </div><div id="coop-internships"><h3>Cooperative Education and Internships</h3><h4>Cooperative Education</h4>
		  <p>Cooperative education is a structured method of combining classroom education and practical work experience.&nbsp;At ACC, cooperative education is defined as employment placement for course credit.</p>
		  <p>Examples at ACC include internship classes, practicums, capstone courses with external placement, independent study courses with external placement, leadership classes, and Health Science clinicals.</p>
		  <h4>Internships</h4>
		  <p>Internships are carefully designed and monitored educational experiences that provide students the opportunity to integrate academic knowledge with practical work experience in a professional setting. They are supervised, mentored, and evaluated experiences that help students test interests, develop new skills, and learn first-hand about the workplace in their field of study.</p>
		  <p>Internships are designed to benefit both students and employers. Students receive real world experience in positions related to their academic major and career goals while employers benefit from their skills and assistance. Employers recruit students to work on special projects, assist with daily tasks, or provide support during times of higher demand.</p>
		  <p>Students earn academic credit, pay, or in some instances, both for the work they provide to their employer.</p>
		  <p>An important element that distinguishes internships from short-term jobs is the intentional &ldquo;learning agenda&rdquo; structured into each experience. Students have specific learning objectives and supervisors serve as mentors, providing opportunities to meet the objectives as part of or in addition to the specific duties of the internship.</p>
		  <h4>Co-Ops</h4>
		  <p>Coops provide part-time work in a student&rsquo;s area of study while the student is enrolled in the college. Like an internship, a coop program is designed to benefit both students and employers. Unlike the internship, a coop program is designed to be a longer term relationship.</p>
		  <p>Academic credit is not earned, and no faculty are assigned to the student. Rather, the student is considered to be a regular part-time employee of the company/agency.</p>
		  <h4>Clinical</h4>
		  <p>Clinical experience is key component in some programs. Students apply theory learned in the classroom, to practice in several clinical settings for &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; experience.</p>
		  <p>Settings for these experiences vary, offering students the opportunity to develop knowledge and skills in areas involving many populations across the lifespan, at medical and/or educational facilities.</p>
		  </div></div><div id="flexible-program-options"><h2>Flexible Program Options</h2><div id="distance-learning-and-alternative-education"><h3>Distance Learning and Alternative Education</h3><h4>Online and Hybrid Courses</h4>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Distance learning is an educational process where the majority of the instruction occurs when students and faculty are not in the same place. Online and hybrid classes offer ACC students a convenient way to earn college credit. Fully online programs and courses are offered at ACC, as are hybrid courses (where there is at least one mandatory on-campus component such as lab work or class meeting) and distance learning courses that require exams to be taken in the campus Testing Center.&nbsp;</span></p>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Course content and transferability in distance learning classes are identical to classes offered on campus, giving students more scheduling options and a wider selection of classes to meet their needs.</span></p>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">For more information on fully online programs and courses, visit <a href="https://online.austincc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online.austincc.edu</a>.</span></p>
		  <h4>Procedures for Protecting Student Privacy in Distance Education Courses and Programs</h4>
		  <p>Austin Community College (ACC) protects the privacy of all students including distance learning students through strict adherence to the rules of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 as Amended (FERPA). The official FERPA statement is available for student and public view through the ACC FERPA website, <u><a href="https://www.austincc.edu/ferpa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.austincc.edu/ferpa</a>,</u> and in the ACC College Catalog and Student Handbook, <u><a href="https://www.austincc.edu/catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.austincc.edu/catalog</a></u>.</p>
		  <p>ACC is committed to protecting student privacy for students enrolled in all courses and programs regardless of the mode of instruction (on-line, hybrid, classroom). All of the college policies regarding student privacy and information security apply to distance education courses and programs. All ACC students and employees to include Faculty teaching distance education courses and programs are expected to uphold these polices and follow these procedures:</p>
		  <p><strong>Identity Verification in Distance Education Courses and Programs</strong></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li><strong>Required to Obtain ACC Student ID In-Person</strong><br>
		  All ACC students, including those involved in distance education, are issued ACC IDs as proof of identity. All students to include distance learning students must obtain their ACC student ID in person at any of ACC&rsquo;s campuses Admissions and Records Office.</li>
		  <li><strong>Student Assigned a Unique Identified &ndash; ACCeID</strong><br>
		  ACC assigns students a unique identifier called ACCeIDs. The ACCeID is a password management system that unifies the usernames and passwords for many ACC applications. Through this system students are also required to remember and provide responses to previously saved questions in case they need to reset their login credentials. The password management system also requires periodic password changes to further reduce the risk of sensitive information being obtained and used outside its intended purpose within the College.</li>
		  <li><strong>Required Use of Secure Login and Password &ndash; With ACCeID Unique Identifier<br>
		  </strong> To ensure that a student who registers for a distance education course is the same student who participates in and completes the course, ACC requires the use of secure login and password. The ACCeID and password is required to access ACC&rsquo;s online learning environment housed within Blackboard, ACC&rsquo;s learning management system.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p><strong>Password Security</strong><br>
		  Both students and faculty are responsible for maintaining the security of their secure-portal login credentials (user name (ACCeID and passwords).</p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Activate ACCeID &ndash;Agree to College&rsquo;s Information Security and Acceptable Use Policy<br>
		  The first time a student login to activate their ACCeID the student must read and agree to the terms of the College&rsquo;s Information Security and Acceptable Use Policy. This policy states that:</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p style="padding-left: 40px"><em>&ldquo;Each individual provided with a system account shall maintain securely and never disclose his/her account password or credentials or knowingly permit another individual to access ACC information systems via his/her account, accept in accordance with a lawful investigation.&rdquo;</em></p>
		  <p><strong>Password Changes</strong></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li><strong>Periodic Password Changes</strong><br>
		  The ACCedID password management system also requires periodic password changes to further reduce the risk of sensitive information being obtained and used outside its intended purpose within the College. The password management system is set to reset the password every 90 days.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p><strong>Blackboard &ndash; Learning Management System &ndash; Online Course Delivery</strong></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li><strong>Access Blackboard&nbsp; &ndash; ACCedID Secure Username and Password</strong><br>
		  Blackboard is the learning management system used by ACC for online course delivery. Students and Faculty access Blackboard by using their ACCeID secure username and password combination created and assigned by ACC.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <ol>
		  <li style="list-style-type: none">
		  <ol>
		  <li>All parties accept responsibility for the security of their personal passwords</li>
		  <li>Blackboard learning management system requires all passwords to be updated every 90 days.</li>
		  <li>Student information is separated from others&rsquo; within Blackboard and from outside intruders.</li>
		  <li>Faculty information is protected from student views within Blackboard and from outside intruders.</li>
		  </ol>
		  </li>
		  </ol>
		  <ul>
		  <li><strong>Professional Use Expectations for College Information Systems</strong><br>
		  The Blackboard login page is used by both students and faculty. Upon login to Blackboard the following statement appears regarding the expectations and policies that users must abide:</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p style="padding-left: 40px"><em>&ldquo;Professional Use Expectations for College Information Systems: Users are expected to comply with ACC&rsquo;s Administrative Rule on the Use of College Information Systems, and to be familiar with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Proceeding to use college information systems indicates your awareness of and commitment to comply with the above-referenced guidelines. If you are unsure of these guidelines or disagree with them, you are expected to exit now and consult with your supervisor or advisor.&rdquo;</em></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li><strong>Faculty Assignment to Courses in Blackboard</strong><br>
		  All faculty members are assigned a shell in Blackboard for each class they teach. The employee ID is assigned to the courses assigned the faculty member. Each student registered in a class will be tied to the course roster within the instructor&rsquo;s course and identified to both the instructor and Blackboard by their individual student ID.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p><strong>Proctored Examinations</strong></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li><strong>ACC Testing Center &ndash; Required to Present Student ID</strong><br>
		  ACC also authenticates and verifies the identity of students involved in distance education through the use of examination proctoring at the ACC Testing Center or other approved remote testing centers by requiring students to present a Student ID. Students complete exams under the scrutiny of testing center personnel.</li>
		  <li><strong>ProctorU web-based &ndash; Verify Student Identity</strong><br>
		  Students may also elect to use the services of ProctorU, a web-based examination proctoring service. This is a fee-based online live-proctoring service. In these instances, ProctorU verifies student identity.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p><strong>Confidential Information Faculty Responsibility</strong><br>
		  Teach distance education courses using Blackboard, the college&rsquo;s approved learning management system, in order to ensure security of student work and grades.</p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Use the college&rsquo;s secure student information systems site to report student grades.</li>
		  <li>Use Blackboard or the college&rsquo;s email system for all official, confidential communication such as providing feedback on student work, releasing grade information to students, etc.</li>
		  <li>Keep student work, scores or grades confidential. Students in the course should not have access to other students&rsquo; work or grades.</li>
		  <li>Keep your Blackboard or email account information secure. Do not share your login information with anyone, give anyone unauthorized access to the Blackboard course or assign a student the role of instructor or graduate assistant in Blackboard.</li>
		  <li>Follow the college&rsquo;s guidelines and FERPA guidelines for sharing student educational record information with other faculty, staff, parents, or others outside the college.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p><strong>Student Responsibility</strong></p>

		  <li>Keep your Blackboard or email account information secure. Do not share your login information with anyone.</li>
		  <li>Do not give anyone unauthorized access to the Blackboard course.</li>
		  <li>Keep his/her login and password confidential. Password reset is completed through a security question protocol.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>Only work submitted to open forums, like discussion boards, can be accessed by other students; other assignments, grades and correspondence are not viewable by other students.</p>
		  <p><strong>Records Management Program</strong><br>
		  The records management administrative rule establishes rules for process for the creation, distribution, organization, maintenance, use, and disposition of college records. Access to student financial records is restricted and limited to authorized users and are only released with the student&rsquo;s permission, which is given through the student&rsquo;s designation within the secure Online Services portal. ACC discloses information from a student education record only with written consent of the student by completing the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/austincc.edu/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=YXVzdGluY2MuZWR1fGFjYy1mb3Jtcy1pbnZlbnRvcnl8Z3g6NWUxMmRlOGQ1MzgyZjA2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Student Proxy Authorization form</a>.</p>
		  <p>To grant permission for the ACC cashier office to discuss the student&rsquo;s account information with others, the student must complete a <a href="https://f7d7f823-a-29cd8ff9-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/austincc.edu/acc-forms-inventory/business-services/Cashiers%20office%20proxy%20authorization.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7crbeFRNeKjDiifDFuoVaaTIpxOK0ILXevyjOHVExmGEh9qe1s3CvA-NX6VKS22XxwkuoymiC1RDI4yfaJN3oI8Bl7ssRRhXKufyNPe0I7JRX-AvETwy9rn14KRkVFlfKAX7T08DGVOeDlTLfRVthY2AqfJnJZXlx2cRMzFJ8ayR7C-qFrc8oQ7fBHslyC2av01mqfHeYTSszC386mPtwZauh3zp-IEkwlu8pSLvQ4kcct0YZHCd8Bj4TU_iK-IAQsHotOYVbMq7YPZs3c9tN70DVRn7ig%3D%3D&amp;attredirects=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cashier Office Proxy Authorization form</a> .

		  <h4>Degree Options</h4>
		  <p>The <strong>Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN)</strong> degree is specifically designed to prepare graduates of Associate Degree Nursing (ADN) and nursing diploma programs, who already hold a Registered Nursing (RN) license, with additional skills in management, leadership, theory, and research to succeed and be promoted within the nursing profession.</p>
		  <p>The <strong>Associate of Arts (AA)</strong> and Associate of Science (AS) degrees are specifically designed to allow for the transfer and application of credits earned at Austin Community College to the bachelor degree requirements of most public colleges and universities. In addition, completion of the Associate of Arts and Associate of Science degrees at ACC also guarantees completion of the state-mandated core curriculum and the acceptance in transfer of a minimum&nbsp;of 42-semester credit hours toward the general education requirements in a bachelor&rsquo;s degree at all state supported higher education institutions in Texas. The Associate of Science degree differs from the Associate of Arts degree primarily in the amount or level of mathematics required for degree completion so students will be prepared to transfer as a junior majoring in the sciences, math or engineering.</p>
		  <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Associate of Arts in Teaching (AAT)</strong> degrees are designed to prepare students to transfer to a Texas public university as a junior with a specific teaching major: Early Childhood-Grade 6, Grades 4-8, or Grades 8-12 .</p>
		  <p>The <strong>Associate of Applied Science degree (AAS) </strong>degrees, offered in technical programs, are designed to prepare students for immediate employment upon graduation. While this degree is not focused on transfer, ACC has formal agreements with partner universities that allow transferability of courses in some ACC programs. Within many of the technologies, short-term <strong>certificate programs</strong>, also preparation for employment, are offered which can be completed in less than two years.</p>

		  <h4>Course Descriptions Information</h4>
		  <p><strong>Course Numbering System</strong></p>
		  <p>Austin Community College has adopted the Texas Common Course Number system, which facilitates the identification of courses that transfer among public institutions. Disciplines identify courses using a four-letter rubric and a four-character number (e.g. ENGL 1301).</p>
		  <p>Under the common course numbering system, the first digit indicates the level at which the course is typically taught (e.g. 1=freshman, 2=sophomore). The second number indicates credit-hour value and the third and fourth numbers indicate sequence of the course. Developmental courses, which are not transferable and therefore not part of the Texas Common Course Number system, have nevertheless adopted a four-character rubric.</p>
		  <p>The three figures in parentheses after the title of each course in&nbsp;the course descriptions listing indicate the number of semester&nbsp;credit hours for the course, the number of lecture hours each&nbsp;week and the number of laboratory or activity hours each week,&nbsp;respectively.</p>
		  <p><strong>Course Entry Requirements</strong></p>
		  <p>Most college-credit courses have one or more skill requirements in reading, writing, or mathematics. (For example, English Composition I requires proficiency in reading and writing.) Proficiency is determined by state-required Texas Success Initiative (TSI) assessment test to determine college-readiness in reading, writing, and math. Proficiency (or exemption) may also be proved with an official transcript from another college. Students must meet proficiency (or exemption) requirements of all courses. Applicable skills requirements are indicated in the course descriptions. A legend of skills requirements is provided below.</p>
		  <h4>Skills Requirement(s) Legend</h4>
		  <p style="padding-left: 40px"><strong>A :</strong> Reading and Special Approval<br>
		  <strong>B :</strong> Reading and Math<br>

		  <p>Other requirements, such as course prerequisites or instructional program approval, must also be met. Visit with an academic advisor, counselor, or faculty member for more information about course requirements and prerequisites.</p>
		  <p><strong>Allied Health Sciences</strong></p>
		  <p>In the health sciences areas, more complete or in-depth course&nbsp;descriptions are available from the individual programs.</p>
		  <p>The Allied Health Sciences (ALHS) program is dedicated to educational excellence. To that end, every effort has been made to develop and offer a diverse range of courses (HPRS) designed to meet student needs and facilitate student success. ALHS is an interdisciplinary program in health sciences whose main responsibility is providing prerequisite and corequisite courses for other Health Science degrees and certificate programs.</p>
		  <p>Additionally, the Allied Health Sciences Department participates in First Day Access, (FDA), Supplemental Instruction(SI), and the Health Science Academy (HSA) to meet the college&rsquo;s mission, and to enhance student success. Every attempt, including technology based learning is used to enhance and strengthen the student&rsquo;s education experiences.</p>
		  <p>A variety of courses in allied health specialties are offered for students who are: (1) seeking enrollment in ACC health science programs such as nursing, surgical and medical laboratory technology, emergency medical services (paramedicine), physical therapy, and pharmacy technician and several other health science programs; (2) co-enrolled in ACC health science programs; (3) transferring into health science programs at other institutions; (4) exploring health science careers; or (5) co-enrolled in public schools and either investigating health careers or planning to continue at ACC in a health science program. Courses are in medical terminology, pharmacology, pathophysiology, and end of life issues. For more information, visit the Allied Health Sciences program website at <a href="http://sites.austincc.edu/health/alhs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sites.austincc.edu/health/alhs</a>.</p>
		  <p><strong>Honors</strong></p>
		  <p>Honors courses are available in many discipline areas.&nbsp;For specific offerings, consult the Schedule of Classes. Additional information is available at <a href="http://sites.austincc.edu/honors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sites.austincc.edu/honors</a>&nbsp;or call&nbsp;512-223-2171.</p>
		  <p><strong>Course Types</strong></p>
		  <p>The designated course type is provided at the end of each course description, except for ACC&rsquo;s bachelor&rsquo;s degree courses (course rubrics that begin with 3 and 4; e.g. NURS 3350) :</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 40px"><strong>T&mdash;Transfer/Academic Courses:</strong> Designated by the Texas&nbsp;Higher Education Coordinating Board for transfer among&nbsp;community colleges and state public four-year colleges and&nbsp;universities as freshman and sophomore general education&nbsp;courses. There is no guarantee, however, that a course which&nbsp;&ldquo;transfers&rdquo; will apply to a specific major or degree at a four-year&nbsp;college or university.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 40px"><strong>W&mdash;WECM Courses:</strong> Designed by the Texas Higher&nbsp;Education Coordinating Board as workforce education&nbsp;(technical) courses offered for credit or Continuing&nbsp;Education Units (CEU&rsquo;s). WECM credit courses are designed&nbsp;to transfer among state community colleges, however, they are&nbsp;not designed to automatically transfer to public four-year&nbsp;college and universities. Continuing education courses do not&nbsp;transfer to semester hour programs or to other colleges.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 40px"><strong>D&mdash;Developmental Courses:</strong> Developmental courses offer a&nbsp;review of a specific academic skill to prepare students for&nbsp;college credit course work. Students can improve their&nbsp;academic success by taking the appropriate reading, writing or&nbsp;math course. Developmental courses do not count toward&nbsp;graduation and do not fulfill any degree requirements at Austin&nbsp;Community College.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 40px"><strong>C&mdash;Certificate Only Courses:</strong> Certificate courses/programs&nbsp;are designed for the person who is not planning to complete a&nbsp;college degree but wants to learn a marketable skill and secure&nbsp;immediate employment. These courses do not apply to any&nbsp;associate or higher degree program.</p>

		  <p>ACC offers the advantage of a wide range of support services. State-of-the-art learning labs and hands-on academic help make college more manageable. Additional services are available for military veterans, foster care alum, students on track to transfer to a four-year university, and many others.</p>
		  <p>Visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.austincc.edu/learning-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.austincc.edu/learning-support</a> for more information on academic resources and services available at ACC.</p>
		  <div id="student-progress"><h2>Student Progress</h2><div id="semester-credit-hours"><h3>Semester Credit Hours</h3><p>Colleges offer courses during a prescribed term or semester. The traditional semester is 16 weeks long in the fall (late August through early December) and spring (mid to late January through mid-May). How many credits you earn for a course is measured by the time and attention you put into learning. For instance, if you take a course that has 3 contact hours per week (hours during which you are in &ldquo;contact&rdquo; with an instructor), you will earn 3 &ldquo;semester credit hours (SCH)&rdquo; upon successfully completing the course. While the length of the semester may vary, a 3 SCH lecture course equates to 3 contact hours per week in a traditional 16-week semester.</p>
		  <p>In addition to traditional 16 week semesters, ACC offers sessions of various lengths,&nbsp; including 12 weeks, 8 weeks, and others. However to ensure the same number of contact hours are achieved, the shorter session means more contact hours per week. For example, a 3 SCH course has 48 contact hours (3 x 16 = 48). If you took the same 3 SCH course in a 12 week semester, you would have 4 contact hours per week (12 x 4 = 48). Similarly, the same 3 SCH course in an 8 week semester would result in 6 contact hours per week (8 x 6 = 48).</p>
		  <p>ADVICE: College courses require study time outside of the class or contact time. A general rule is that you should plan for at least 2 hours of study/preparation outside of class for each 1 hour of class time. If you take a &ldquo;full load&rdquo; of 12-15 SCH in a semester, that means you should plan for a total time commitment of 36 hours per week for a 12 SCH course load, and 45 hours per week for a 15 SCH course load. That&rsquo;s why this courseload represents a &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; student. Many students opt for a part-time course load of 6-9 SCH because of outside work or family commitments. Plan and manage your time wisely.</p>
		  <p>An Associate Degree typically requires a student to complete 60 SCH and a Baccalaureate Degree typically requires the completion of 120 SCH.</p>
		  </div><div id="courseload"><h3>Courseload</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Full-time Student: You are considered a full-time student if you register for the following minimum number of credits:</span></p>

Read through it carefully, and ask your professor about any questions you have or areas you may not understand.</p>
		  </div><div id="class-cancellations"><h3>Class Cancellations</h3><p>Classes may be canceled prior to the start of the semester for low enrollment.

		  </div><div id="attendance"><h3>Attendance</h3><p>Austin Community College values academic excellence and believes that students should demonstrate commitment to this value.</p>
		  <p>You are expected to attend classes in order to satisfactorily complete course objectives. For distance learning courses, you are expected to comply with the course syllabus requirements.</p>
		  <p>You will be informed, via a written course syllabus, of all course objectives and the instructor&rsquo;s course policies. A student who is not in compliance with course policies or not meeting course objectives in the syllabus may be withdrawn from the course at the discretion of the instructor. A student who has been marked as ‘Never Attended&rsquo; on the instructor&rsquo;s attendance certification roster, will be administratively withdrawn from the course, effective one day prior to the official reporting date for the course.</p>
		  <p>It is your responsibility to consult with instructors and meet with your advisor when course policies and objectives, such as the attendance policy, cannot be met. You are strongly encouraged to officially drop/withdraw if you stop attending class for any reason.</p>
		  <p>Your instructor may initiate your withdrawal from class if your attendance is unsatisfactory. Instructor-initiated withdrawals count toward state limits on course withdrawals.</p>
		  <p>When the instructor withdraws a student or the student is administratively withdrawn, written notice will be sent by the college to the faculty email address and to ACC student email address. The student may appeal a withdrawal in writing immediately upon notification within five (5) business days after receipt of the college notice of withdrawal. The written appeal shall be made initially to the course instructor, who will respond in writing within five (5) business days. The student may appeal the instructor&rsquo;s decision within five (5) business days to the appropriate Department Chair, then the Dean, whose decision will be final.</p>
		  <p>Excused Absence for Religious Holidays: In accordance with state law, ACC allows an excused absence to students for the observance of a &ldquo;religious holy day,&rdquo; defined as a holy day observed by a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property taxation under Section 11.20, Tax Code. You are excused from attending classes or other required activities, including exams, during travel for and observation of a religious holy day. The law mandates that you must complete assignments or exams missed during the absence within a reasonable time. The instructor may appropriately respond if you fail to satisfactory complete the assignment or examination.</p>

		  <h4>Incomplete Grade</h4>
		  <p>An instructor may award a temporary grade of Incomplete (I) to students who are unable to finish a course at the end of a semester due to an emergency or other unanticipated circumstances. A new completion date is determined by the instructor, but it may not be later than the final withdrawal deadline in the subsequent semester. When the student completes the required work by the Incomplete deadline, the instructor will submit a form to change the student&rsquo;s performance grade from an &ldquo;I&rdquo; to the earned grade of A, B, C, D, or F. If an Incomplete is not resolved by the deadline, the grade automatically converts to an F.</p>
		  <p>Approval to carry an Incomplete for longer than the following semester or session deadline is not frequently granted. An extension of an &ldquo;I&rdquo; grade must be approved by the faculty member and department chair.</p>
		  <h4>In Progress Grade</h4>
		  <p>An instructor may award an In Progress (IP) grade to students in developmental education courses. An IP may be awarded if a student did not achieve the standards for earning a C or better in the course and the student demonstrated regular attendance and some progress. The student will register again for the course to successfully complete the course objectives. An In Progress is a final grade that counts toward your semester courseload but carries no grade points or credit toward graduation.</p>
		  <p>An In Progress does not indicate successful completion of course objectives, nor does it satisfy Texas Success Initiative (TSI) requirements. If you earn an In Progress, you must re-register for the course during your next semester registration unless you complete TSI requirements through other means.</p>
		  <p>An In Progress shall not to be used as an alternative to an Incomplete or an F. You do not qualify for an In Progress if you have excessive absences.</p>
		  <p>You may receive an IP in the same course two times. On the third attempt, you must receive an A, B, C, D, or F.</p>
		  <h4>Satisfactory/Fail Grades</h4>
		  <p>The Satisfactory/Fail grade option applies to only a limited group of practicum courses. Consult an instructional program or area for information about this grade option.</p>
		  <p>You must have a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 to meet the requirements of Academic Standards of Progress.</p>
		  </div><div id="droppingwithdrawing-from-courses"><h3>Dropping/Withdrawing from Courses</h3><p>You may withdraw, or drop, from a 16-week course or from the college with a grade of W any time on or before the end of the 12th class week in the fall or spring 16-week session. Shorter semesters have prorated drop dates.</p>
		  <p>If you drop a course before its census date, or official reporting date, the course is deleted from your enrollment, does not earn any grade, and does not appear on your transcript. If you drop a course after the census date, a grade will be included on your transcript.</p>

		  <h4>Academic Standards of Progress</h4>
		  <p>The College maintains a system for monitoring academic progress to identify those students experiencing academic difficulty. The College will intervene in a student&rsquo;s academic life when circumstances warrant, will limit enrollment and course selection if considered necessary, and may employ additional interventions that foster and encourage academic success.</p>
		  <p>Students receiving financial aid also must comply with the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy for Financial Aid Recipients.</p>
		  <h4>The College&rsquo;s academic standings and interventions are:</h4>
		  <p><strong>Good Standing<br>
		  </strong>Cumulative 2.0 or greater Grade Point Average (GPA.) The student receives a congratulatory statement.<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <p><strong>Warning<br>
		  </strong>A student who does not meet a cumulative 2.0 or greater GPA.</p>
		  <p>Intervention: Registration hold applied. The student is notified of the academic standing and must meet with an advisor, completion counselor, or success coach&nbsp;and develop a plan for improvement in order to register.</p>
		  <p><strong>Probation<br>
		  </strong>Warning moves to Probation when a student does not meet the cumulative 2.0 GPA during the subsequent semester of enrollment. The student must follow the requirements of a performance improvement plan and will remain on Probation as long as the semester GPA is 2.0 or greater.<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <p>Intervention: Registration hold applied. The student must meet with a completion counselor or success coach for improvement in order to register.</p>
		  <p><strong>Suspension<br>
		  </strong>Probation moves to Suspension when a student on Probation does not meet the standard of a semester 2.0 or greater GPA during the subsequent semester of enrollment. The student is suspended for one semester.<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <p>Intervention: Registration hold applied. Student is notified that:</p>
		  <p>The student is suspended and may not enroll in any ACC credit courses for the indicated period. The student may have the opportunity to enroll for the semester under some stipulations. To be considered for conditional enrollment, the student must meet with a completion counselor or success coach for an Academic Standards of Progress Review. With the Dean or Associate Dean of Student Affairs approval, the completion counselor or success coach and the student will develop a plan for academic improvement, including a midsemester report on academic progress.</p>
		  <p><strong>Conditional Reinstatement<br>
		  </strong>Suspension moves to Probation after the suspension period. The student will remain on Probation as long as the semester GPA is 2.0 or greater. A student not meeting semester requirements will be suspended for one semester.<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <p>Intervention: Registration hold applied. The student is notified of the academic standing and must meet with a completion counselor or success coach and develop a plan for improvement in order to register.</p>
		  <p>A student&rsquo;s academic status returns to Good Standing at any point that the student meets the cumulative 2.0 or greater GPA.</p>
		  </div><div id="handling-academic-problems"><h3>Handling Academic Problems</h3><h4>Faculty Office Hours</h4>
		  <p>All faculty have office hours, which are times set aside just to meet with students outside of class. Consult your syllabus to determine your instructor&rsquo;s office hours and plan to meet with him or her during that time. Many times, concerns about the class or your grades &mdash; or additional opportunities to learn &mdash; can be remedied with a meeting during office hours.</p>
		  <h4>Copyright &amp; Duplication of Course Materials</h4>
		  <p>Austin Community College recognizes and respects intellectual property ownership, including copyrights. Copyright infringement violates the reasonable expectations of the copyright owner to have exclusive control over the materials they create. Copyrights are property rights and are protected by federal statute. Copying or reproduction of materials without permission of the copyright owner, or distribution or republication of those materials without permission, is copyright infringement. This includes the making and disseminating of copies by or on electronic media, as well as the more familiar method of copy machine reproduction. In particular, the posting of materials on the Internet, or the transmission of documents by electronic mail, is an infringing use of materials when it is done without permission.</p>
		  <p>ACC expects its students to respect the rights of the college and of their professors and other instructors or staff who use or permit the use of copyright protected materials for instruction. Of course, textbooks and other commercial publications used as text or supplemental materials are copyright protected. It is copyright infringement to make or disseminate copies of such materials in whole or part without permission. Most, if not all, other course materials &mdash; course syllabi or outlines, course bibliographies or reading lists, lecture or other supplemental handouts, review notes or outlines that are handed out, tests or individual test questions, test answers, and other instructional materials provided to you by your professor or other instructors &mdash; are also copyright protected materials. The content of materials does not belong to the student. The student enrolled in a course has only limited permission, a non exclusive license, to use those materials, and that permission is limited to use strictly in conjunction with that student&rsquo;s participation in the course in which the student is enrolled.</p>
		  <p>Following the intent of ACC&rsquo;s Administrative Rule 4.02.007, no instructional materials may be reproduced or disseminated by students except for the exclusive use of students enrolled in the course in which such materials have been provided. In particular, course materials may not be posted on the Internet without express written permission. Violations are subject to civil penalties or criminal prosecution under the federal Copyright Act of 1976, as amended. In addition, students who violate this rule regarding copyright infringement are subject to college disciplinary action. It is a condition of a student&rsquo;s enrollment in courses at Austin Community &nbsp;College that he or she respect the copyrights of others and adhere to the Copyright Administrative Rule.</p>
		  <p>As outlined in Administrative Rule 4.02.006, students retain copyright ownership rights to materials they create to satisfy course assignments or other course requirements (e.g., essays, photographs, audio-visual materials, computer programs, tests) using generally available college resources. ACC retains an unlimited license to use work created by students for educational purposes.</p>
		  <p>If a student has any questions about ownership of materials he or she has created, the student can also direct these inquiries to the associate vice president of instructional resources and technology.</p>
		  <h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
		  <p>Austin Community College values academic integrity in the educational process. The following information is ACC&rsquo;s Academic Integrity Policy and Disciplinary Process when the policy has been violated.</p>
		  <p>Acts of academic dishonesty/misconduct undermine the learning process, present a disadvantage to students who earn credit honestly, and subvert the academic mission of the institution. The potential consequences of fraudulent credentials raise additional concerns for individuals and communities beyond campus who rely on institutions of higher learning to certify students&rsquo; academic achievements, and expect to benefit from the claimed knowledge and skills of their graduates.</p>
		  <h4>Purpose</h4>
		  <p>The Academic Integrity and Disciplinary Process is established to foster and protect one of the core missions of the College, which is to assess and certify students&rsquo; academic achievements. When assignments and exams reflect honest efforts and legitimate accomplishments, the academic progress of those students can be measured accurately and, in turn, any credentials awarded to them can reliably and fully attest to their actual academic achievements.</p>
		  <h4>Application of the Rule</h4>
		  <p>The Academic Integrity and Disciplinary Process is a part of the Student Standards of Conduct and Disciplinary Process (AR 1.04.006) which applies to the on-campus conduct of all students. The code also applies to the off-campus conduct of students in direct connection with:</p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Academic course requirements or any credit-bearing experiences, such as internships, field trips, study abroad, or student teaching, research at other institutions or professional practice assignments;</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>The Academic Integrity and Disciplinary Process governs students enrolled at all College campuses, centers, and in distance learning courses. A student alleged to have engaged in acts of academic dishonesty/misconduct is not permitted to withdraw from a course or from the College until allegation(s) are resolved.</p>
		  <p>Students continue to be subject to federal, state, and local laws, and violations of those laws may also constitute violations of the Academic Integrity and Disciplinary Process in the Student Standards of Conduct and Disciplinary Process (AR 1.04.006). In such instances, the College may proceed with disciplinary measures independent of any legal proceeding that involves the same violation. The College may also impose sanctions independently of legal authorities, even if the legal proceedings are not yet resolved, or are resolved in the student&rsquo;s favor.</p>
		  <h4>Student Rights</h4>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Students have the right to receive a detailed course syllabus within the first week of class. Each syllabus should include course policies, instructor expectations, instructor office hours and location, instructor contact information, and grading requirements.</li>
		  <li>Students have the right to receive a clear explanation of proper documentation in research assignments/projects, including but not limited to, a definition of plagiarism.</li>
		  <li>Students have the right to timely academic evaluation that is fair and consistent.</li>
		  <li>Students have the right to engage respectfully and appropriately in the free and open expression of ideas and opinions.</li>
		  <li>Students alleged to have engaged in acts of academic dishonesty/misconduct have the right to due process in the resolution of the allegation.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h4>Prohibited Conduct</h4>
		  <p>Any student found to have engaged, or attempted to engage, in any of the following conduct shall be subject to disciplinary action as set forth in these Guidelines. An attempted violation shall be defined as conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the prohibited conduct.</p>
		  <p>Academic Misconduct</p>
		  <p>Academic misconduct refers to any activity that compromises academic integrity or subverts the educational process, including but not limited to the following:</p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Violation of rules contained in the course syllabus;</li>
		  <li>Violation of College rules regarding the use of academic facilities, including labs and testing centers; Using or providing unauthorized information during exams;</li>
		  <li>Using or providing unauthorized materials or devices during exams;</li>
		  <li>Using or providing unauthorized assistance in labs, on field work, in scholarship, or on a course assignment;</li>
		  <li>Submitting plagiarized work for an academic assignment or requirement;</li>
		  <li>Falsification, fabrication, or dishonesty in creating or reporting laboratory or research results;</li>
		  <li>Falsification, fabrication, or dishonesty in creating any assignment;</li>
		  <li>Serving as, or enlisting the assistance of, a substitute for a student in any assignment, exam or course requirement;</li>
		  <li>Alteration of grades in an effort to change the earned or assigned grade or credit;</li>
		  <li>Alteration or unauthorized use of academic records or forms;</li>
		  <li>Engaging in activities that unfairly place other students at a disadvantage, such as taking, hiding, or altering resource materials.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h4>Disciplinary Actions and Due Process for Academic Misconduct</h4>
		  <p><strong>Reporting Violations<br>
		  </strong>All members of the College community are ethically bound to report suspected violations of academic dishonesty. Cases of suspected academic dishonesty should be reported to one or more of the following College officials:<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>the instructor</li>
		  <li>the program chair</li>
		  <li>the instructional area dean</li>
		  <li>the campus dean of student services</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>If the complaint is received by an official other than the instructor, the official who receives the complaint should forward the complaint to the instructor as soon as possible.</p>
		  <p>When an instructor suspects or witnesses a violation of academic integrity, or receives a report of an alleged violation, the instructor shall notify the program chair, and meet privately and individually with the accused student(s) to discuss the allegations and review the supporting evidence. The student may not withdraw from the course or the College during the disciplinary review process.</p>
		  <p><strong>Resolution/Penalties<br>
		  </strong>In consultation with the program chair, the instructor may resolve the matter in one or more of the following ways:<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Dismissing the allegation;</li>
		  <li>Issuing a written warning that further violations may result in additional penalties;</li>
		  <li>Requiring the student to revise or replace the work in which the violation occurred;</li>
		  <li>A reduction in the grade on the work in question;</li>
		  <li>A failing grade on the work in question;</li>
		  <li>A failing grade or other denial of credit in the course;</li>
		  <li>Recommending disciplinary sanctions to the Dean of Student Services.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>Within 5 (five) business days of the meeting with the student, the instructor shall provide written notification of the resolution to the student, the program chair, the instructional area dean, for informational purposes, and to the Dean of Student Services, for possible disciplinary action.</p>
		  <p>Due process will not be delayed because a faculty member is off-contract. In the event that the accusing faculty member is unable to participate in the investigation and/or appeal, the program chair or dean will represent the interests of the faculty member.</p>
		  <p>Multiple offenses of academic dishonesty will result in progressively more severe disciplinary sanctions up to and including expulsion from the College.</p>
		  <p><strong>Appeals<br>
		  </strong>A student found to be in violation of academic integrity has the right to appeal the instructor&rsquo;s decision(s). Appeals must be made in writing to the instructional program chair, within 10 (ten) business days following notification of the &nbsp;Instructor&rsquo;s decision(s). The appeal must state the specific grounds for appeal and should include all supporting documentation. Students have the right to appeal only once for each academic integrity violation. Students are encouraged to meet with a College counseling faculty member to explore options prior to submitting an appeal.<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <p>Within 7 (seven) business days of receipt of a student&rsquo;s written appeal, the program chair, in consultation with the instructional dean, shall request that the vice president of instruction convene an Academic Integrity Appeals Panel hearing.</p>
		  <h4>Academic Integrity Appeals Panel Hearing</h4>
		  <p><strong>Composition of the Academic Integrity Review Panel<br>
		  </strong>The Panel will be composed of seven members, appointed by the vice president of instruction, as follows:<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>an instructional dean, who will serve as Panel chair</li>
		  <li>a Student Services dean</li>
		  <li>four faculty members, including at least one from outside the instructional area</li>
		  <li>one Student Government Association member</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>Members of the Academic Integrity Appeals Panel cannot be involved in, nor have direct knowledge of, the case or the accused.</p>
		  <p><strong>Hearing Procedures<br>
		  </strong>The Academic Integrity Appeals Panel hearing is closed to the public. The instructor and the accused student will each present evidence to support their respective positions.<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <p>A student will be found by the hearing panel in violation if the evidence supports the charge(s). If, after exhaustive deliberations, the review panel cannot reach a majority decision, the student will be found not in violation. A written notice of the decision will be provided to the accused student and the faculty member within 5 business days of the Academic Integrity Review Panel Hearing. The Panel&rsquo;s decision is final.</p>
		  <p><strong>Attendance and Postponement of Disciplinary Review Panel Hearing<br>
		  </strong>The student who has been charged with a violation may request a postponement of the hearing for reasonable cause. Because the most accurate and fair review of the facts can best be accomplished when both parties (student and instructor) are present, the accused student is expected to attend and to participate. If the student chooses not to attend the hearing, the charges will be reviewed as scheduled on the basis of the information available, and a decision will be made. Although no inference may be drawn against a student for failing to attend, or for remaining silent, the hearing will proceed and the conclusion will be based on the evidence presented. No decision shall be based solely on the failure of the student to attend or participate.<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <p><strong>Sanctions<br>
		  </strong>For a student found to have engaged in Academic Misconduct, the Academic Integrity Review Panel may uphold the sanction(s) imposed by the instructor and may recommend that the appropriate Dean of Student Services impose one or more of the following sanctions:<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Suspension;</li>
		  <li>Expulsion from the College;</li>
		  <li>Denial or revocation of degree or other credential</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p><strong>Record of Proceedings<br>
		  </strong>A single record consisting of written notes, electronic recordings, or other method selected by Panel chair, will be made of all hearings. Such record will remain the property of the College but will be made available to the accused for review during any appeal period.<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  <p>It is the responsibility of the Academic Integrity Review Panel chairperson to send written notification to the student, the faculty member and the College Registrar of any grade change resulting from the Panel&rsquo;s decision.</p>
		  <p><strong>Confidentiality and Records Retention<br>
		  </strong>Records of violations of the Student Standards of Academic Integrity may be shared with College officials who have a legitimate interest in the case. These records will be retained in accordance with the Texas Records Retention Law and other applicable laws. Except in cases of legally sanctioned requests, student records may be disclosed outside the College only with the student&rsquo;s signed consent.<strong><br>
		  </strong></p>
		  </div><div id="student-grade-disputes"><h3>Student Grade Disputes</h3><p>All course grades are awarded by the instructor of record. At the beginning of the course, your instructor will inform you of course requirements and grading policies via the course syllabus. Your instructor shall exercise professional judgment in the application of those policies and the awarding of grades. All grades are final except in the case of college error.</p>
		  <h4>Resolving Disputes About a Grading Policy and/or a Specific Assignment Grade</h4>
		  <p>If you have a question about a grading policy and/or a specific assignment grade, you must raise your question while enrolled in the course. Meet with your instructor and discuss your questions or objections. Document in writing what you discuss and the outcome of that discussion in case you later request a formal Review of Final Course Grade.</p>
		  <p>If you are unable to resolve your questions or objections with your instructor, make an appointment with the instructional department chair to discuss the matter or, if the instructor is the department chair, with the instructional area dean. Instructional department chairs and deans can be found here: <a href="https://www.austincc.edu/instructional-departments-and-divisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.austincc.edu/instructional-departments-and-divisions</a></p>
		  <h4>Resolving Disputes About Final Course Grades</h4>
		  <p>If you have questions about your final course grade, you must contact your instructor within three months after the grade was awarded. If you cannot contact the instructor, contact the instructional department chair. If the department chair is also the instructor who awarded the grade, the instructional area dean will act in place of the department chair.</p>
		  <p>If the grade awarded was not the grade your instructor intended, your instructor will initiate a Grade Change Request Form to correct the error. Address any follow-up questions to your instructor or the department chair.</p>
		  <p>If the grade awarded was the grade your instructor intended but you believe there was an error, you may request a formal Review of Final Course Grade.</p>
		  <h4>Review of Final Course Grade</h4>
		  <p>A request for a Review of Final Course Grade may be submitted only if you are unable to resolve the dispute either with your instructor or with the assistance of the department chair. You are encouraged to make an appointment with a Student Services advisor to discuss the process before preparing a formal request.</p>
		  <p>In order to begin this process, you must submit your written request including evidence of college error and relevant supporting documentation to the department chair within three months after the grade was awarded. The department chair will forward your request to the dean who oversees that program. Late requests or deadline extensions will be approved only if there are documented extenuating circumstances.</p>
		  <p>The instructional area dean will give your instructor a copy of your written request and ask the instructor to provide a written response. The dean will give you a copy of the instructor&rsquo;s written statement. If the college no longer employs the instructor who awarded the grade, the dean will make a diligent effort to locate the instructor to obtain a written statement. (If the instructor is unavailable, the dean, in consultation with the department chair, will give you a written statement containing all relevant information available to them.) During the process of writing and exchanging statements, the instructor may choose to change the grade or you may withdraw your request for review. If neither of these occurs, the dean shall appoint a three-member faculty Grade Review Committee to consider the request.</p>
		  <p>The Grade Review Committee will consist of three members, including a required representative outside the instructional department. None of your current instructors, at the time the committee meets, will be on the committee. You may exercise your option to have a Student Government Association representative participate on the committee. If possible, one of the committee members will be an adjunct faculty member in the discipline. The committee members will determine the steps they take in reviewing your request. There is no requirement for you to appear before the committee, but you may request to do so. You will not be present when the committee considers your request.</p>
		  <p>The Grade Review Committee will meet in private to protect the confidentiality of all student records. Only committee members will be present during committee deliberations. The dean will explain the committee&rsquo;s decision in writing to you, your instructor, and the department chair. <strong>The committee&rsquo;s decision is final.</strong> If the decision requires a grade change, the dean will initiate the paperwork to make the grade change.</p>

		  <p>Austin Community College (&ldquo;ACC&rdquo; or &ldquo;College&rdquo;) promotes the exchange of knowledge in an environment that encourages reasoned discourse, intellectual honesty, and respect for the rights of all persons. In support of this goal, the primary purpose of the following Student Standards of Conduct and Disciplinary Process is to educate and guide students to understand their responsibilities in regard to appropriate behavior and respect for others in the College community.</p>

A Conduct Notification Report detailing alleged violations of the Student Standards of Conduct by an ACC student must be completed. &nbsp;The general disciplinary procedure is as follows:</p>
		  <ol style="padding-left: 45px">
		  <li>The alleged violation must be reported using a Conduct Notification Report and submitted to the appropriate Dean or Associate Dean of Student Affairs.

Interim suspension may be imposed to ensure the physical or emotional safety and well-being of the complainant or others and/or prevent the respondent from engaging in any disruptive or destructive activity on property owned or controlled by the College or at any College-sponsored event or activity.&nbsp; Interim suspensions will be supported by evidence that the continued presence of the student at the College may pose a significant threat to others, to College property, or to the stability and continuance of normal College functions.&nbsp; The interim suspension is effective immediately on the date notification is issued.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 45px"><strong>1. Right to a meeting:</strong> A student issued an interim suspension will be given prompt opportunity to meet with the Dean or Associate Dean of Student Affairs. The conference is limited to discussion about the reliability of the information concerning the student&rsquo;s conduct, and whether the conduct and surrounding circumstances reasonably indicate that the student&rsquo;s presence poses a substantial and immediate threat to himself or herself or to others or to the stability and continuance of normal College functions.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 45px"><strong>2. Appealing an interim suspension:&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;The student may request a meeting to appeal the interim suspension with the appropriate Regional Executive Dean of Student Affairs. &nbsp;The meeting is limited to discussion about the reliability of the information concerning the student&rsquo;s conduct, and whether the conduct and surrounding circumstances reasonably indicate that the student&rsquo;s presence poses a substantial and immediate threat to himself or herself, to others, to property, or to the stability and continuance of normal college functions. The Regional Executive Dean of Student Affairs will affirm or rescind the interim suspension and provide notification to the student within two (2) business days of the meeting.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>H. Hold on student records<br>
		  </strong>In pending cases that could result in disciplinary action, the Dean or Associate Dean of Student Affairs may place a hold on the student&rsquo;s records and will notify the student in writing of such a hold.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>I. Cases involving criminal charges<br>
		  </strong>Students may be accountable both to local, state, or federal authorities and to the College for acts that violate the law and the Student Standards of Conduct. &nbsp;The college&rsquo;s disciplinary process will proceed without regard to criminal proceedings and their outcome.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px">If the College is notified of an off campus incident, that may have resulted in criminal charges against an enrolled student, the College will assess the information received to determine if the incident has a substantial connection to the interests of the College, and/or poses a safety threat to the College or an individual or group of individuals at the College.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>J. Notice to victims of violence<br>
		  </strong>Results of directly related disciplinary proceedings may be released to the victim of a violent crime or non-forcible sex offense, upon written request.&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>K. Disciplinary records<br>
		  </strong>The College shall maintain for every student determined to have committed misconduct at the College, a disciplinary record that provides details regarding the violation, the disposition of the charge, and the sanction assessed, if any, and any other pertinent information.&nbsp; The disciplinary record shall be separate from the student&rsquo;s academic record and shall be treated as confidential; the contents shall not be revealed except on request of the student or in accordance with applicable state or federal laws.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px">The disciplinary record shall be maintained permanently in the event that a student is expelled or subject to an extended suspension.&nbsp; In all other cases, the disciplinary record shall be maintained in accordance with the College record retention schedule.</p>

		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Austin Community College District (&ldquo;ACC or &ldquo;the College&rdquo;) seeks to maintain an educational environment free from any form of discrimination or harassment including but not limited to discrimination or harassment on the basis of disability in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA).</span></p>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended provides that no otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. &nbsp;The ADAAA contains a similar requirement that no governmental entity may discriminate against or permit discrimination against an otherwise qualified individual on the basis of the person&rsquo;s disability. Harassment is considered under these laws to be a form of discrimination.</span></p>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">ACC prohibits discrimination against or harassment of qualified students with disabilities on the basis of disability in connection with all academic, educational, extra-curricular, and other programs of the College, whether they take place in the facilities of the College, at a class or training program sponsored by the College at another location, or elsewhere. &nbsp;This policy applies whether the alleged harasser is an ACC employee, a fellow student, a visitor to the College, or a vendor of the College.</span></p>
		  <h4>Administrative Rule</h4>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">ACC prohibits discrimination or harassment of all forms, including but not limited to behavior such as physical, verbal, or nonverbal misconduct based on a student&rsquo;s disability that is so severe, persistent, or pervasive that the misconduct:</span></p>
		  <ol>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Affects a student&rsquo;s ability to participate in or benefit from an educational program or activity, or creates an intimidating, threatening, hostile, or offensive educational environment;</span></li>

		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Otherwise adversely affects the student&rsquo;s educational opportunities.</span></li>
		  </ol>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nonacademic and extracurricular services shall be provided in a manner as is necessary to afford students with disabilities an equal opportunity for participation in such services and activities.</span></p>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The College shall exercise reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct discriminating or harassing behavior and shall develop preventative or corrective measures to address these behaviors.</span></p>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">ACC also prohibits retaliation against anyone for reporting discriminating or harassing behavior or for participating in discrimination or harassment investigations or lawsuits.</span></p>

		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="font-weight: 400">Complaints must be brought within 180 calendar days of the last incident of discrimination or harassment. A complaint may be submitted to the ADA Coordinator in writing or verbally, and should include dates, times, places, witnesses, and specifics of what was said and done. The complaint may also include proposed resolutions acceptable to the student. &nbsp;</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="font-weight: 400">The student shall also be informed of his or her right to file a complaint with the United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights.</span>The ADA Coordinator shall coordinate with the appropriate Dean, and review the complaint. &nbsp;If the situation cannot be resolved through informal means, to the satisfaction of all parties, an investigator will be appointed.</p>
		  <ol start="2">
		  <li>All complaints will be promptly addressed. &nbsp;Based upon an initial assessment of the allegations by the ADA Coordinator and the appropriate Dean, pre-investigation measures may be temporarily taken to insure the safety and peace of mind of the student. &nbsp;Such measures may include, without limitation, placing the person against whom the complaint was made on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation or separating the student and the person against whom the complaint has been made. &nbsp;All complaints will be confidential to the extent permitted by law, and will be revealed only on a &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; basis (i.e. access to the information is necessary to the investigation and/or the safety of the accused and the accuser or required by law).</li>
		  <li>The investigator will review the written material submitted by the student and meet with the student in a private area to discuss the complaint as soon as possible but not later than ten (10) College business<sup>3</sup> days after the complaint has been received. &nbsp;The investigator will also meet with any witnesses and secure a witness statement from each witness. &nbsp;The investigator may consult with the appropriate Dean to identify alternative methods for resolving the complaint.</li>
		  <li>The investigator will meet with all persons with information relevant to the complaint. &nbsp;If the complaint is filed against an individual, the person(s) against whom the complaint was filed should be given at least three (3) College business days to review the complaint and any relevant supporting documents and to prepare a written response to the complaint prior to meeting with the investigator. &nbsp;At the meeting, the investigator should provide the person against whom the complaint was filed an opportunity to respond verbally to the complaint. The person(s) may also respond to the complaint in writing, and may identify additional witnesses the investigator should interview. The investigator will determine from this meeting whether additional witness interviews are warranted and if any additional information needs to be gathered or considered.</li>
		  <li>After meeting with the person(s) against whom the complaint was filed, if any, gathering any additional information or witness statements, and concluding the investigation, the investigator will make a recommendation, in writing, to the ADA Coordinator and the appropriate Dean. &nbsp;The recommendation will set forth the following: complaint, persons interviewed, documents reviewed, findings, conclusions, and recommendations. &nbsp;The investigation of the complaint should be concluded within sixty (60) College business days of the receipt of the complaint.</li>
		  <li>If additional time is needed, the investigator shall notify the complainant and respondent. In any event, the investigation is considered &ldquo;open&rdquo; until the written final action document is issued.</li>
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dean, in consultation with the ADA Coordinator, will determine the final action to be taken in response to the complaint.&nbsp; The ADA Coordinator will notify both the complainant and the respondent of the outcome of the investigation, consistent with FERPA.</span></li>
		  </ol>
		  <p><b>Appeals<br>
		  </b><span style="font-weight: 400">If found to have violated ADA, the Respondent may appeal to the appropriate vice president. &nbsp;Appeals shall be granted only on one or more of the following grounds:</span></p>
		  <ol>
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400"> If there was a specified procedural error (or errors) in the interpretation of the College regulations that were so substantial as to effectively deny the party appealing a fair investigation or resolution process;</span></span></li>
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400"> If new and significant evidence has become available which could not have been discovered by a properly diligent person during the original investigation; or</span></span></li>
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400"> &nbsp;If the final action(s) is/are disproportionate to the offense for which the respondent was found responsible.</span></li>
		  </ol>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Disagreement with the outcome of the investigation does not in and of itself constitute grounds for appeal. </span></p>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Appeals are not heard in person; instead a request for appeal must be submitted in writing to the appropriate Vice President within five (5) College business days from the date on the letter notifying the Respondent of the finding. Failure to appeal within the allotted time will render the finding final.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">The appeal will be based upon the written complaint and response contained in the investigative record. &nbsp;The appeal should be resolved within ten (10) College business days of the date of the filing of the appeal. The decision of the appropriate vice president is final and is not appealable any further within ACC.</span></p>

		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Austin Community College District (&ldquo;ACC or &ldquo;College&rdquo;) seeks to maintain an educational environment free from any form of discrimination or harassment including but not limited to discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, or National Origin in accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</span></p>
		  <h4>Purpose</h4>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that no person shall, on the basis of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. Harassment is considered under the law to be a form of discrimination.</span></p>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">ACC prohibits discrimination against or harassment of students<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">on the basis of race, color, or national origin in connection with all academic, educational, extra-curricular, and other programs of the College, whether they take place in the facilities of the College, at a class or training program sponsored by the College at another location, or elsewhere. This policy applies whether the alleged harasser is an ACC employee, a fellow student, a visitor to the College, or a vendor of the College.</span></p>
		  <h4>Administrative Rule</h4>
		  <p>ACC prohibits discrimination or harassment of all forms, including but not limited to behavior such as physical, verbal, or nonverbal misconduct based on a student&rsquo;s race, color, or national origin that is so severe, persistent, or pervasive that the misconduct:</p>
		  <ol>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Affects a student&rsquo;s ability to participate in or benefit from an educational program or activity, or creates an intimidating, threatening, hostile, or offensive educational environment;</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Has the purpose or effect of substantially or unreasonably interfering with the student&rsquo;s academic performance; or</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Otherwise adversely affects the student&rsquo;s educational opportunities.</span></li>
		  </ol>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The College shall exercise reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct discriminating or, harassing behavior and shall develop preventative or corrective measures to address these behaviors. ACC also prohibits retaliation against anyone for reporting discriminating or harassing behavior or for participating in discrimination or harassment investigations or lawsuits.</span></p>
		  <p><b>Discrimination or Harassment<br>
		  </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, or national origin may be based on intentional conduct that constitutes disparate treatment of a student or may be based on disparate impact or disparate effects of a facially neutral procedure or policy. Intentional conduct occurs when similarly situated students are treated differently because of their race, color, or national origin. Disparate impact occurs when facially neutral procedures or policies have a disproportionate adverse effect on persons on the basis of their race, color, or national origin without substantial legitimate justification.</span></p>
		  <h4>Notice of Student Rights and&nbsp;ACC Complaint Process</h4>
		  <p><b>Investigation Process &amp; Resolution<br>
		  </b>Every student and every person against whom a complaint is made is entitled to due process. Therefore, the College&rsquo;s investigation will include interviews with all relevant persons including the complainant<sup>2</sup>, the alleged harasser, and other potential witnesses. The results of the investigation will determine the appropriate course of action. ACC will take steps to prevent recurrence of any harassment and to correct its discriminatory effects on the complainant and others, if appropriate.<b><br>
		  </b></p>
		  <ol>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Students who believe they have been the object of or observed discrimination or harassment based on race, color, or national origin have the right to make the complaint with the Title VI compliance officer identified below. Complaints must be brought within 180 calendar days of the last incident of discrimination or harassment. The complaint should include dates, times, places, witnesses, and specifics of what was said and done. The complaint may also list proposed resolutions acceptable to the student. </span></li>

		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="font-weight: 400">Students shall also be informed of their right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights at <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/index.html</a></span>&nbsp;or by calling (800-421-3481).</span></p>
		  <ol start="3">
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400">The Title VI Coordinator shall coordinate with the appropriate instructional or student services Dean and review the complaint. &nbsp;If the situation cannot be resolved through informal means, to the satisfaction of all parties, an investigator will be appointed.</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">All complaints will be promptly addressed. Based upon an initial assessment of the allegations by the Title VI Coordinator and the appropriate Dean, pre-investigation measures may be temporarily taken to insure the safety and peace of mind of the student. Such measures may include, without limitation, placing the person against whom the complaint was made on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation or separating the student and the person against whom the complaint has been made. All complaints will be confidential to the extent permitted by law, and will be revealed only on a &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; basis (i.e. access to the information is necessary to the investigation and/or the safety of the accused and the accuser or required by law).</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The investigator will review the written material submitted by the student and meet with the student in a private area to discuss the complaint as soon as possible but not later than ten (10) College business<sup>3</sup></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> days after the complaint has been received. The investigator will also meet with any witnesses and secure a witness statement from each witness. The investigator may consult with the appropriate Dean to identify alternative methods for resolving the complaint.</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The investigator will meet with all persons with information relevant to the complaint. If the complaint is filed against an individual, the person(s) against whom the complaint was filed should be given at least three (3) College days to review the complaint and any relevant supporting documents and to prepare a written response to the complaint prior to meeting with the investigator. At the meeting, the investigator should provide the person against whom the complaint was filed an opportunity to respond verbally to the complaint. The person(s) may also respond to the complaint in writing, and may identify additional witnesses the investigator should interview.</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The investigator will determine from this meeting whether additional witness interviews are warranted and if any additional information needs to be gathered or considered.</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">After meeting with the person(s) against whom the complaint was filed, if any, gathering any additional information or witness statements, and concluding the investigation, the investigator will make a recommendation, in writing, to the Title VI Coordinator and the appropriate Dean. The recommendation will set forth the following: complaint, persons interviewed, documents reviewed, findings, conclusions, and recommendations. The investigation of the complaint should be concluded within sixty (60) College business days of the receipt of the complaint.</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">If additional time is needed, the investigator shall notify the complainant and respondent. The investigation is considered &ldquo;open&rdquo; until the written final action document is issued.</span></li>
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dean, in consultation with the Title VI Coordinator, will determine the final action to be taken in response to the complaint. &nbsp;The Title VI Coordinator will notify both the complainant and the respondent of the outcome of the investigation, consistent with FERPA.</span></li>
		  </ol>
		  <p><b>Appeals<br>
		  </b><span style="font-weight: 400">If found to have violated Title VI, the Respondent may appeal to the appropriate Vice President. Appeals shall be granted only on one or more of the following grounds: </span></p>
		  <ol>
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400"> If there was a specified procedural error (or errors) in the interpretation of the College regulations that were so substantial as to effectively deny the party appealing a fair investigation or resolution process; </span></li>
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400"> If new and significant evidence has become available which could not have been discovered by a properly diligent person during the original investigation; or</span></li>
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400"> If the final action(s) is/are disproportionate to the offense for which the respondent was found responsible.</span></li>
		  </ol>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Disagreement with the outcome of the investigation does not in and of itself constitute grounds for appeal. </span></p>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Appeals are not heard in person; instead a request for appeal must be submitted in writing to the appropriate Vice President within five (5) College business days from the date on the letter notifying the Respondent of the finding. Failure to appeal within the allotted time will render the finding final. The appeal will be based upon the written complaint and documentation contained in the investigative record. The appeal should be resolved within ten (10) College business days of the date the appeal was filed. The decision of the appropriate Vice President is final and is not appealable any further within ACC.</span></p>

		  <p>State law allows an individual to have the sexual assault forensic exam (SAFE) up to 96 hours (4 days) after the sexual assault.&nbsp; An individual can report to law enforcement, if the person chooses to do so.&nbsp; In Texas, you have ten years (statute of limitations on sexual assault) to make the report. Having a sexual assault forensic exam conducted allows an individual to preserve evidence that will be lost over time before you decide how to proceed.</p>
		  <p>ACC District police officers and City of Austin police officers encourage victims/survivors to report the sexual assault even if it is past the statute of limitations.&nbsp; The case cannot go forward with prosecution, but it is important to document the assault and the perpetrators who commit them (in addition to allowing ACC to prevent recurrence of similar crimes, if applicable.)</p>
		  <p>In circumstances of sexual assault, if a victim/survivor does not opt for forensic evidence collection, health care providers still can treat injuries and take steps to address concerns of pregnancy and/or sexually-transmitted infection. It is important that a victim/survivor of sexual assault not bathe, douche, smoke, change clothing or clean the bed/linen/area where she or he was assaulted within 96 hours after the incident occurred so that evidence may be preserved.</p>
		  <p>Victim/survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking also are encouraged to preserve evidence by saving text messages, instant messages, social networking pages, other communications, and keeping pictures, logs or other copies of documents, if any exist that may be useful to College investigators, ACC District Police Department, or local police.</p>
		  <h4>Investigations</h4>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Victims/survivors who wish to pursue an investigation may choose to: </span></p>
		  <ol>
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400">Contact the ACC District Police Department to pursue a criminal investigation if the reported conduct occurred on property owned or controlled by ACC. </span></li>
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400">Contact the local police department or sheriff&rsquo;s department to pursue a criminal investigation.</span></li>
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400">File a civil complaint in a civil court. &nbsp;(This action may require you to obtain your own attorney.)</span></li>
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400">Report to the ACC District Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator for your campus (see contact information in this document). An investigation of a campus policy violation is independent from criminal or civil investigations and the District Title IX Coordinator accepts complaints of all kinds of conduct (criminal and non-criminal) as well as conduct that occurred on and off campus. </span></li>
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400">Decide not to file charges or make a report for investigation. Victims/Survivor are strongly encouraged but not required to report the incident. Victims/Survivor have the right to be free from any suggestion that victims/survivors must report the crime to be assured of any other rights or resources. Campus personnel will not pressure survivors to report a crime if the survivor does not wish to report but will assist any person in filing a report with law enforcement no matter where the misconduct occurred. </span></li>
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400">Report anonymously online through the link below, which is provided on the College&rsquo;s homepage:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.austincc.edu/forms/sexual-misconduct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.austincc.edu/forms/sexual-misconduct</a></li>
		  <li><span style="font-weight: 400">A victim/survivor may report to all of the above and have concurrent criminal and administrative investigations. &nbsp;ACC will not wait for the completion of a criminal investigation to begin or conduct its&rsquo; administrative investigation.</span></li>
		  </ol>
		  <h4>Accommodations</h4>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">A victim/survivor may make a request for accommodations to the District Title IX Coordinator (or one of the Deputy Title IX Coordinator&rsquo;s). The victim/survivor does not need to participate in an investigation or file charges in order to request accommodations. The District Title IX Coordinator will work in conjunction with relevant parties to determine which measures are appropriate to ensure the victim&rsquo;s safety and equal access to educational programs and activities. Accommodations include:</span></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Accommodations related to academics, transportation, and working environment. If an alleged perpetrator and alleged victim/survivor are enrolled in the same class, a request to drop the class without any academic penalty will be granted.</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Relocation in their on-campus job if either will bring them into proximity with the perpetrator. Survivors may also request changes to their class schedule if they have classes in common with the perpetrator. </span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">A &ldquo;no-contact&rdquo; order may be put in place between the victim/survivor and the accused party<sup>3 </sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400">or if the accused party is a non-ACC member, the institution should work with law enforcement to prohibit the party from entering campus property. </span></li>

		  <h4>I. Policy Statement</h4>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is the policy of the Austin Community College District (&ldquo;ACC&rdquo; or the &ldquo;College&rdquo;) to maintain an environment for students, employees, and visitors that is free of all forms of discrimination and harassment, including sexual misconduct. &nbsp;The College has enacted this Prohibition of Sexual Discrimination or Sexual Violence or Sexual Harassment Policy (the &ldquo;Sexual Misconduct Policy&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Policy&rdquo;) to reflect and maintain its institutional values and community expectations, to provide for fair and equitable procedures for determining when this Policy has been violated, and to provide recourse for individuals and the community in response to violations of this Policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">So that the College may continue to foster a climate of respect and security on its campuses and ACC owned or operated sites as it relates to preventing and responding to acts of sexual misconduct, this policy has been created and serves to demonstrate the College&rsquo;s commitment to:</span></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Prohibiting all forms of gender and sex-based harassment and discrimination, defined as &ldquo;sexual misconduct&rdquo; by ACC, to include sexual harassment, non-consensual sexual penetration and contact, sexual exploitation, stalking, dating violence, and domestic violence as well as gender-based harassment and discrimination that is non-sexual;</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Disseminating clear policies and procedures for responding to sexual misconduct reported to the College; </span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Responding to and addressing reports of sexual misconduct that may not rise to the level of unlawful discrimination or harassment in order to prevent a hostile environment from occurring;</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Delivering primary prevention and awareness programs and ongoing training and education campaigns to students and employees so they may identify what behavior constitutes sexual misconduct; understand how to report such misconduct; recognize warning signs of potentially abusive behavior and ways to reduce risks; and learn about safe and positive options for bystander intervention that may be carried out by an individual to prevent harm or intervene when there is a risk of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking against a person other than such individual;</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Engaging in investigative inquiry and resolution of reports that are prompt, fair, equitable, and independent of other investigations that may occur;</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Supporting and protecting the rights of victims/survivors and accused parties, as well as holding persons accountable for established violations of this policy; </span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Providing a written explanation of the rights and options available to every student or employee that has been the victim/survivor of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking, regardless of whether the offense occurred on or off campus; and</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Addressing the policy&rsquo;s impact on contractors and visitors to ACC facilities.</span></li>
		  </ul>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, this policy:</span></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Identifies the College&rsquo;s District Title IX Coordinator, Deputy Title IX Coordinators, and Title IX Investigators, and describes their roles.</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Identifies how students and employees can report sexual misconduct to the College confidentially and what resources are available both on and off campus to aid them, including employees&rsquo; and students&rsquo; rights to notify local law enforcement and their right also to decline to notify such authorities.</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Provides information about how reports are assessed, investigated, and resolved.</span></li>
		  <li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Provides the College with a means to take all reasonable steps to identify harassment, prevent recurrence of any harassment, and to correct its discriminatory effects on the complainant and others, if appropriate.</span></li>
		  </ul>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>A.&nbsp; &nbsp;ACC&rsquo;s Prohibition Against Sex Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct</strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">ACC does not discriminate on the basis of sex in its educational, extracurricular, or other programs or in the context of employment.&nbsp; Sex discrimination-including pregnancy and related conditions- is prohibited by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, a federal law that provides:</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">This Policy prohibits all forms of sex and gender-based discrimination, harassment, and misconduct, including non-consensual sexual penetration, non-consensual sexual contact, intimate partner violence, sexual exploitation, and stalking.&nbsp; This Policy also prohibits retaliation against a person who reports, complains about, or who otherwise participates in good faith in, any matter related to this Policy.&nbsp; All of the foregoing sexual misconduct shall be referred to as &ldquo;Prohibited Conduct&rdquo;, even if the behavior does not rise to the level of unlawful conduct. Engaging in any conduct as defined in Section V can be a violation of this Policy even if the behavior does not rise to the level of unlawful conduct.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Sexual harassment is also prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Texas Penal Code, and other applicable statutes.&nbsp; This Policy prohibits sexual harassment against ACC community members of any sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression in the context of education or employment.&nbsp; This Policy also prohibits gender-based harassment that does not involve conduct of a sexual nature.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">ACC also prohibits other forms of discrimination and harassment, including discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, ethnicity, ancestry, age, religious belief, marital status, physical or mental disability, medical condition, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law. Such prohibited conduct is addressed in other Board Policy and College Administrative Rules prohibiting discrimination, harassment and retaliation based on protected status (other than sex or gender).</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>B.&nbsp; &nbsp;Commitment to Address Sexual Misconduct</strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon receipt of a complaint or a report, the College will take prompt and equitable action to eliminate the Prohibited Conduct (if any), prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects. &nbsp;In addition, the College will fulfill its obligations under the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (&ldquo;VAWA&rdquo;) amendments to the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (&ldquo;Clery Act&rdquo;) in response to reported Prohibited Conduct. &nbsp;The College&rsquo;s process for investigating and responding to reported Prohibited Conduct is contained in the following Section VI. Students or employees who are found to have violated this Policy may face disciplinary action up to and including expulsion (students) or termination of employment (faculty, staff, or other employees).&nbsp;</span></p>
		  <h4>II. Scope of the Policy</h4>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">This Policy applies to all reports of Prohibited Conduct occurring on or after the effective date of this Policy. &nbsp;Where the date of the reported Prohibited Conduct precedes the effective date of this Policy, the definitions of misconduct in existence at the time of the report will be used. &nbsp;The Investigation Process under this Policy, however, will be used to investigate and resolve all reports made on or after the effective date of this Policy, regardless of when the incident(s) occurred.</span></p>
		  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">When used in this Policy, &ldquo;Complainant&rdquo; usually refers to the individual who is identified as the subject alleging to have been harmed by the Prohibited Conduct. &nbsp;In limited circumstances the College may serve as the Complainant. In the case of dual credit or early college high school students, a Third Party may serve as the Complainant when reporting on behalf of minor students. &nbsp;&ldquo;Respondent&rdquo; refers to the individual alleged to have engaged in Prohibited Conduct. A &ldquo;Third-Party&rdquo; refers to any other participant in the process, including a witness or an individual who makes a report on behalf of a Complainant. The roles of administrators are explained in greater detail later in this document.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>A.&nbsp; &nbsp;Persons Covered &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">This Policy applies to all ACC community members, including stude<span style="color: #000000">nts<sup>4</sup></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400"><span style="color: #000000">, fa</span>culty, administrators, staff, volunteers, vendors, contractors, visitors, and individuals regularly or temporarily employed, conducting business, studying, visiting, or having any official capacity with the College or on its property. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The College strongly encourages reports of Prohibited Conduct regardless of who engaged in the conduct. &nbsp;Even if the College does not have jurisdiction over the Respondent, the College will take prompt action to provide for the safety and well-being of the Complainant and the broader campus community and prevent recurrence, if possible.</span></p>
		  <hr>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><sup>4</sup> Dual credit students are subject to this Policy.&nbsp; For purposes of this Policy a student is someone who is not currently enrolled but is registered for classes in the future, was previously enrolled and is able to enroll in the future, or withdraws any time after notification of the allegation. Students who also serve in the capacity of an employee of the College will be subject to the procedures determined by the District Title IX Coordinator to be most appropriate.</p>
		  <hr>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>B.&nbsp; &nbsp;Locations Covered&nbsp;</strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">This Policy applies to all on-campus conduct and some off-campus conduct, described below.&nbsp; The College strongly encourages reports of Prohibited Conduct regardless of location.&nbsp; Even if the Policy does not apply to the conduct because of its location, the College will take prompt action to provide for the safety and well-being of the Complainant and the broader campus community and to prevent recurrence, if applicable.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><em><u>On-Campus Conduct</u></em>.&nbsp; This Policy applies to conduct that occurs on-campus, including conduct which occurs on property owned or controlled by the College.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><em><u>College Programs.</u></em>&nbsp; This Policy applies to conduct that occurs in the context of College employment or education programs or activities.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><em><u>Off-Campus Conduct</u></em>.&nbsp; This Policy also applies to conduct that occurs off-campus and has continuing adverse effects on, or creates a hostile environment for, any member of the ACC community on-campus or in any College employment or education program or activity.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>C.&nbsp; &nbsp;Confidentiality and Privacy</strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>i. Privacy and Confidentiality: Understanding the Differences</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">The College is committed to protecting the privacy of all individuals involved in the investigation and resolution of reports under this Policy. &nbsp;The College also is committed to assisting students, employees, and Third-Parties in making informed choices. With respect to any report under this Policy, the College will make reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of participants, in accordance with applicable state and federal law, while balancing the need to gather information to take steps to eliminate Prohibited Conduct, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects. &nbsp;All College employees who are involved in the College&rsquo;s Title IX response receive specific instruction about respecting and safeguarding private information. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">Privacy and confidentiality have distinct meanings under this Policy.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>ii. Privacy</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&ldquo;Privacy&rdquo; generally means that information related to a report of Prohibited Conduct will only be shared with a limited circle of individuals who &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; in order to assist in the assessment, investigation, or resolution of the report.&nbsp; While not bound by confidentiality, these individuals will be discreet and respect the privacy of all individuals involved in the process.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The privacy of student education records will be protected in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (&ldquo;FERPA&rdquo;), as outlined in the Administrative Rule 3.03.015, which details the College&rsquo;s regarding the confidentiality of student records.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The privacy of an individual&rsquo;s medical and related records may be protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (&ldquo;HIPAA&rdquo;), excepting health records protected by FERPA and by Texas state law.&nbsp; Access to an employee&rsquo;s personnel records may be restricted by applicable Texas and federal law.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">While there are certain limitations on privacy, the College generally will not release the names of the Complainant or Respondent to the general public without express written consent or absent another exception consistent with the law.&nbsp; The release of names will be guided by applicable law, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Clery Act, and the Texas Public Information Act.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">ACC&rsquo;s employment policies set forth disciplinary consequences for an employee who releases confidential student information.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>iii. Confidentiality</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&ldquo;Confidentiality&rdquo; generally means that information shared by an individual with designated authority on a campus or community professionals cannot be revealed to any other individual without the express permission of the individual.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The confidentiality of information shared by an individual with designated campus or community professionals generally is governed by Texas law, including restrictions on disclosure of information by mental health providers, ordained clergy, rape crisis counselors, and attorneys, all of whom have legally protected confidentiality.&nbsp; These individuals are prohibited from breaking confidentiality unless there is an imminent threat of harm to self or others.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">An individual who seeks confidential assistance may do so by speaking with professionals who have a legally protected confidentiality.&nbsp; The confidential resources available to individuals on campus are listed in Section III below.&nbsp; Note, however, that these confidential resources are required by Texas state law to notify child protective services and/or local law enforcement of any report which involves suspected or known abuse of a minor under the age of 18.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>iv. Responsible Employees and Requests for Confidentiality</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">A &ldquo;Responsible Employee&rdquo; includes any employee who: (1) has the authority to take action to redress the harassment; (2) has the duty to report to appropriate College officials sexual harassment or any other misconduct by students or employees; or (3) a student could reasonably believe has the authority or responsibility to take action.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Certain employees have been designated by the College as Responsible Employees. This includes supervisors, faculty members (including professors, adjuncts, lecturers, and associate/assistant instructors) and all staff in the ACC District Police. &nbsp;Any other ACC employee who receives such information shall immediately report it to a supervisor for handling in accordance with this policy.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The College requires that all Responsible Employees share a report of sexual misconduct with the District Title IX Coordinator or a Deputy Title IX Coordinator, even if a request for confidentiality has been made.&nbsp; The purpose of this requirement is to permit the College to take immediate and corrective action to respond to allegations of Prohibited Conduct.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">A person may desire to report Prohibited Conduct to the College but to maintain confidentiality; if so, the District Title IX Coordinator will evaluate such requests.&nbsp; Where a Complainant requests that the Complainant&rsquo;s name or other identifiable information not be shared with the Respondent or that no formal action be taken, the &nbsp;District Title IX Coordinator will balance the Complainant&rsquo;s request with the College&rsquo;s dual obligation to provide a safe and nondiscriminatory environment for all College community members and to remain true to principles of fundamental fairness that ordinarily provide for notice and an opportunity to respond before action is taken against a Respondent.&nbsp; In making this determination, the College may consider a number of factors including the seriousness of the conduct, the respective ages and roles of the Complainant and Respondent, whether there have been other complaints or reports of harassment or misconduct against the Respondent, and the rights of the Respondent to receive notice and relevant information before disciplinary action is sought.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The College will take all reasonable steps to investigate and respond to the complaint consistent with the request for confidentiality or request not to pursue an investigation, but its ability to do so may be limited based on the nature of the request by the Complainant.&nbsp; Where the College is unable to take action consistent with the request of the Complainant, the District Title IX Coordinator will inform the Complainant about the chosen course of action, which may include the College seeking disciplinary action against a Respondent.&nbsp; Alternatively, the course of action may also include steps to limit the effects of the alleged harassment and prevent its recurrence that do not involve formal disciplinary action against a Respondent or revealing the identity of the Complainant.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>v. Disclosures Required by the Clery Act </i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>1. Timely Warnings</strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">A &ldquo;Timely Warning&rdquo; or &ldquo;Crime Alert&rdquo; is a District-wide notification of a serious or continuing threat to the ACC community. &nbsp;The Timely Warning does not</span><span style="font-weight: 400">include identifying information about the Complainant. &nbsp;If a report of misconduct discloses a serious or continuing threat to the ACC community, the College will issue a District-wide timely warning or crime alert (which will take the form of an email or text message sent to the entire ACC community) to protect the health or safety of the community.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>2. Annual Reporting Responsibilities</strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">The College receives federal funding, and therefore is obligated to issue publicly an Annual Security Report (&ldquo;ASR&rdquo;) which identifies the number of particular types of reported crimes on campus or campus owned or controlled property, or adjacent to campus. &nbsp;The ASR does not include identifying information about the Complainant or Respondent.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>3. Crime Log</strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">The College must maintain a daily crime log that includes entries for all crimes that occur within both the Clery geography and the ACC District Police Department&rsquo;s patrol jurisdiction. &nbsp;The crime log does not include identifying information about the Complainant or Respondent.</span></p>
		  <h4>III. Options for Assistance Following an Incident of Sexual Assault</h4>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>A.&nbsp; &nbsp;Immediate Assistance </strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The College is committed to treating all members of the ACC community with dignity, care, and respect.&nbsp; Any community member who experiences or is affected by violations under this Policy, whether as a Complainant or a Respondent, will have equal access to support and counseling services through the College.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The College strongly encourages individuals to report Prohibited Conduct.&nbsp; The College recognizes, however, that the decision to report Prohibited Conduct (to the College and/or law enforcement) can be difficult.&nbsp; The College strongly encourages individuals who are considering whether to report Prohibited Conduct to seek the support of confidential campus and community resources, listed in this policy, in particular the licensed professional counselors located on each campus.&nbsp; These trained professionals can provide guidance in making decisions, information about available resources and procedural options, and assistance to either the Complainant or Respondent in the event that a report and/or resolution under this Policy is pursued.&nbsp; These resources are available regardless of when or where the incident occurred.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">There are many resources available on campus and in the surrounding community.&nbsp; As noted below, there are Confidential Resources which by law cannot share information without the consent of the individual seeking assistance (in most circumstances).&nbsp; There are also a variety of College resources that will be discreet and private but are not considered confidential.&nbsp; These resources will maintain the privacy of an individual&rsquo;s information within the limited circle of those involved in the resolution of a complaint under this Policy.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>i. Confidential Resources (Non-Medical)</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">The College strongly encourages all community members to make a prompt report of any incident of Prohibited Conduct to local law enforcement and the College. &nbsp;For individuals who are not prepared to make a report, or who may be unsure how to proceed, but are still seeking information and support, there are several legally-protected confidential resources available as designated below. &nbsp;These confidential resources will not share information with the College or anyone else without the individual&rsquo;s permission.</span></p>

The local Child Protection Team is also represented on the SARRT for coordination purposes. &nbsp;The SARRT meets monthly to coordinate services, problem solve and work for improved community and systematic response to sexual assault victims/survivors. ACC is a member of the Austin Sexual Assault Response &amp; Resource Team.</span></p>

		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Victims/survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence have medical needs regardless of if they plan to engage with the criminal justice system (or this administrative process.)&nbsp; A medical provider can provide emergency and/or follow-up medical services.&nbsp; The medical exam has two goals: first, to diagnose and treat the full extent of any injury or physical effect (including prevention of sexually transmitted illnesses and pregnancy) and second, to properly collect and preserve evidence.&nbsp; There is a limited window of time (within 96 hours) following an incident of sexual assault to preserve physical and other forms of evidence, although it may be possible to obtain evidence from towels, sheets, clothes, and other items for longer periods of time.&nbsp; Victims/survivors are encouraged to have evidence collected in the event that they want to cooperate right away with law enforcement OR have not yet made a decision regarding making a police report, but want to have the evidence collected and saved in the event they do opt to make such a report in the future.&nbsp; It is best to gather evidence prior to washing a person&rsquo;s body or changing clothing.&nbsp; If clothes have been changed, the clothes worn at the time of the incident should be brought to the examination in a clean, sanitary container such as a paper grocery bag or wrapped in a clean sheet (plastic containers do not breathe and may render evidence useless).&nbsp; A change of clothing should also be brought to the hospital, as the clothes worn at the time of the incident will likely be kept as evidence.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Taking the steps to gather evidence immediately does not commit an individual to any particular course of action.&nbsp; The decision to seek timely medical attention and gather any evidence, however, will preserve the full range of options to seek resolution under this Policy or through the pursuit of criminal prosecution, and may be helpful in obtaining protective orders and/or proving that a crime of violence occurred.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">ACC does not have on-campus Student Health facilities.&nbsp; Victims/survivors of any of the offenses in this policy should seek help by visiting an area hospital. A victim/survivor will not be required to pay for the cost of a sexual assault forensic exam.&nbsp; Payment of the forensic exam does not include the costs associated with any medical treatment provided outside the forensic portion of a medical exam.</p>

		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>i.&nbsp; &nbsp;Overview</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Upon receipt of a report, the College will provide reasonable and appropriate accommodations and interim measures designed to eliminate the alleged hostile environment and protect the Parties involved.&nbsp; The College will make reasonable efforts to communicate with the Parties to ensure that all safety, emotional and physical well-being concerns are being addressed.&nbsp; Interim measures may be imposed regardless of whether formal disciplinary action is sought by the Complainant or the College, and regardless of whether the crime is reported to ACC District Police or local law enforcement.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">A Complainant or Respondent may request a No Contact Order or other protection, or the College may choose to impose interim measures at its discretion to ensure the safety of all Parties, the broader College community, and/or the integrity of the process.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The College will maintain the privacy of any remedial and protective measures provided under this Policy to the extent practicable and will promptly address any violation of the protective measures.&nbsp; All individuals are encouraged to report concerns about failure of another individual to abide by any restrictions imposed by an interim measure.&nbsp; The College will take immediate and responsive action to enforce a previously implemented restriction if such restriction was violated.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>ii.&nbsp; &nbsp;Range of Measures</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">After careful consideration, interim measures will be implemented at the discretion of the College. Potential remedies, which may be applied include:</span></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li style="list-style-type: none">
		  <ul style="padding-left: 45px">
		  <li>Access to counseling services and assistance in setting up an initial appointment, both on or off campus;</li>
		  <li>Imposition of campus &ldquo;No Contact Order;&rdquo;</li>
		  <li>Rescheduling of exams and assignments (in conjunction with the appropriate faculty)</li>
		  <li>Providing alternative course completion options (in conjunction with the appropriate faculty);</li>
		  <li>Change in class schedule, including the ability to take an &ldquo;incomplete,&rdquo; drop a course without penalty or transfer sections (in conjunction with the appropriate faculty);</li>
		  <li>Change in work schedule or job assignment;</li>
		  <li>Limiting an individual or organization&rsquo;s access to certain College facilities or activities pending resolution of the matter;</li>
		  <li>Voluntary leave of absence;</li>
		  <li>Providing an escort to ensure safe movement between classes and activities;</li>
		  <li>Assisting with access to medical services;</li>
		  <li>Providing academic support services;</li>
		  <li>Interim suspension or College-imposed leave;</li>
		  <li>Any other remedy that can be tailored to the involved individuals to reasonably achieve the goals of this Policy.</li>
		  </ul>
		  </li>
		  </ul>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>iii.&nbsp; &nbsp;Interim Suspension or Separation</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Where the reported conduct poses a substantial and immediate threat of harm to the safety or well-being of an individual, members of the campus community, or the performance of normal College functions, the College may place a student or employee or College organization on interim suspension or impose leave for an employee.&nbsp; Placement on interim suspension may be done by the District Title IX Coordinator, or designee for the reasons stated above. Pending resolution of the report, the individual or organization may be denied access to campus, campus facilities, and/or all other College activities or privileges for which the student or employee might otherwise be eligible, as the College determines appropriate.&nbsp; When interim suspension or leave is imposed, the College will make reasonable efforts to complete the investigation and resolution within an expedited time frame.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The District Title IX Coordinator, or designee, has the discretion to place a student on interim suspension.&nbsp; A student Respondent who has been put on interim suspension has the right to a meeting within three (3) business days<sup>5 </sup>with the appropriate Deputy Coordinator/Executive Dean to appeal the interim suspension.&nbsp; The Deputy Coordinator reviews the appeal to determine whether the decision to put a student on interim suspension was arbitrary or capricious. A decision is arbitrary and capricious where there is no rational connection between the facts presented and the decision made.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Provisions for suspension of faculty members are contained in the Faculty Handbook.&nbsp; Suspensions of other College employees shall be made in accordance with the Administrative Rules.&nbsp; All employees of the College accused of Prohibited Conduct may be placed on leave at the discretion of the College.</p>
		  <hr>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><sup>5 </sup> College business days are Monday through Friday, except when the College is closed on dates noted in the Academic calendar for holidays and breaks, or due to weather related closure if closed for a full business day.</p>

		  <h4>IV. The Title IX Coordinator and Deputy Coordinators</h4>
		  <p>The Austin Community College District is a system of campuses and other locations that are owned or controlled by the College.&nbsp; As such, it has a large number of employees and students and is spread across part of the state of Texas.&nbsp; In order to fulfill the duties associated with this policy and resolution procedures and to ensure that students and employees impacted by Prohibited Contact have access to administrators with responsibility for this policy and resolution procedure, the District has appointed a&nbsp;District Title IX Coordinator to oversee compliance with Title IX, but has also appointed three Regional Deputy Title IX Coordinators who serve specific campus(es).</p>
		  <p>The District Title IX Coordinator is supported and assisted by the three Regional Deputy Coordinators.&nbsp; Collectively, the District Title IX Coordinator, the Deputy Coordinators, Investigators, and other ACC representatives, are the &ldquo;Title IX Team.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Title IX Team is a circle of individuals who have a &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; of any alleged Prohibited Conduct to effectuate this Policy.&nbsp; The foregoing individuals receive appropriate and annual training as required by the Clery Act as amended by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 to discharge their responsibilities.</p>
		  <p>The District Title IX Coordinator monitors the College&rsquo;s overall compliance with Title IX, ensures appropriate training and education, and oversees the College&rsquo;s investigation, response, and resolution of reports made under this Policy by working closely with the Regional Deputy Title IX Coordinators across the District.&nbsp; Upon receiving reports of Prohibited Conduct, the District Title IX Coordinator ensures that appropriate action is taken to eliminate that conduct, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects.&nbsp; The District Title IX Coordinator is available to advise all individuals, including individuals who have experienced misconduct, individuals who are alleged to be responsible for misconduct, and third-parties, on this Policy and the appended Investigation Processes.</p>
		  <p>The College has designated Charlene Buckley to serve as the College&rsquo;s District level Title IX Coordinator.&nbsp; The three Regional Deputy Title IX Coordinators have responsibility for specific campuses.

		  <h4><b>V.&nbsp; &nbsp;Prohibited Conduct &amp; Definitions</b></h4>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>A.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sex or Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination </strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sex or gender-based discrimination refers to the disparate treatment of a person or group because of that person&rsquo;s or group&rsquo;s sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>i. Sexual or Gender-Based Harassment&nbsp; &nbsp;</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&nbsp;&ldquo;Sexual Harassment&rdquo; is any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favors, or other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, whether verbal, physical, graphic, or otherwise. Sexual harassment that does not rise to the level of unlawful harassment may be considered a violation of this Policy.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&ldquo;Unwelcome Conduct&rdquo; is conduct that is unwelcome if the conduct was not requested or invited by the individual or others, and the conduct was regarded as undesirable or offensive<sup>6 </sup>. Unwelcome sexual conduct that is mildly offensive or involves isolated incidents that are not pervasive or severe and have not deprived an individual of access to employment or educational programs, is not considered unlawful sexual harassment. However, conduct or behavior of this nature may still be considered a violation of this policy. The College has zero tolerance for any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature and will take appropriate corrective action if the alleged conduct is substantiated.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Administrators or supervisors should take corrective action when inappropriate incidents occur in order to address the behavior, or prevent similar conduct from occurring so that the behavior does not become unlawful harassment.&nbsp; If the alleged conduct rises to the level of unlawful harassment, the conduct will be addressed through the Policy.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&ldquo;Gender-Based Harassment&rdquo; is harassment based on sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, which may include acts of aggression, intimidation, or hostility, whether verbal, physical, graphic, or otherwise.&nbsp; To qualify as Gender-Based Harassment, the conduct need not involve conduct of&nbsp;a sexual nature. Gender-based harassment that does not rise to the level of unlawful harassment is considered a violation of this Policy.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&ldquo;Unlawful Harassment&rdquo; is conduct that creates an intimidating, offensive, or hostile working or learning environment or that unreasonably interferes with work or academic performance based on a person&rsquo;s protected status, including sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.</p>
		  <hr>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><sup>6</sup> Office for Civil Rights, <em>Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance </em>(66 Fed. Reg. 5512, Jan. 19, 2001)</p>
		  <hr>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Sexual or Gender-Based Harassment:</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; May be blatant and intentional and involve an overt action, a threat or reprisal, or may be subtle and indirect, with a coercive aspect that is unstated.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; May be committed by anyone, regardless of gender, age, position or authority.&nbsp; While there is often a power differential between two persons, perhaps due to differences in age, social, educational or employment relationships, harassment can occur in any context.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; May be committed by a stranger, an acquaintance, or someone with whom the Complainant has an intimate or sexual relationship.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; May be committed by or against an individual or may be a result of the actions of an organization or group.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; May occur by or against an individual of any sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; May occur in the classroom, in the workplace, in residential settings, or in any other setting.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; May be a one-time event or can be part of a pattern of behavior.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; May be committed in the presence of others or when the Parties are alone.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; May affect the Complainant and/or third Parties who witness or observe harassment and are affected by it.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Examples of conduct that may constitute Sexual Harassment as defined above may include one or more of the following:</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; <strong>Physical conduct</strong>, including unwelcome touching, sexual/physical assault, impeding, restraining, or blocking movements, or unwanted sexual advances;</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; <strong>Verbal conduct</strong>, including making or using derogatory comments, epithets, slurs or humor; verbal abuse of a sexual nature, graphic verbal commentaries about an individual&rsquo;s body, sexually degrading words used to describe an individual, suggestive or obscene letters, notes, or invitations; or objectively offensive comments of a sexual nature, including persistent or pervasive sexually explicit statements, questions, jokes, or anecdotes;</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; <strong>Visual conduct</strong>, including leering, making sexual gestures, displaying of suggestive objects or pictures, cartoons, or posters in a public space or forum; or severe, persistent, or pervasive visual displays of suggestive, erotic, or degrading sexually oriented images that are not pedagogically appropriate;</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; <strong>Written conduct</strong>, including letters, notes or electronic communications containing comments, words, or images described above;</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; <strong>Quid pro quo conduct</strong>, including direct propositions of a sexual nature between those for whom a power imbalance or supervisory or other authority relationship exists; offering educational or employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors; making submission to sexual advances an actual or implied condition of employment, work status, promotion, grades, or letters of recommendation, including subtle pressure for sexual activity, an element of which may be repeated requests for private meetings with no academic or work purpose; or making or threatening reprisals after a negative response to sexual advances.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Generally speaking, unlawful harassment can be divided into two types of conduct:</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&nbsp;1.&nbsp; <strong>Quid Pro Quo Harassment</strong>.&nbsp; Submission to or rejection of such conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of an individual&rsquo;s employment, academic standing, or participation in any aspect of a College program or activity or is used as the basis for the College&rsquo;s decisions affecting the individual.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">2.&nbsp; <strong>Hostile Environment</strong>.&nbsp; A hostile environment exists when the conduct is sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent that it unreasonably interferes with, limits, or deprives an individual from participating in or benefiting from the College&rsquo;s education or employment programs and/or activities.&nbsp; Whether conduct is sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent is determined both from a subjective and objective perspective.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Harassing conduct can take many forms.&nbsp; The determination of whether an environment is hostile is based on the totality of the circumstances, including but not limited to:&nbsp; (1) the frequency of the conduct; (2) the nature and severity of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct was physically threatening; (4) the effect of the conduct on the Complainant&rsquo;s mental or emotional state, with consideration of whether the conduct unreasonably interfered with the Complainant&rsquo;s educational or work performance and/or College programs or activities; (5) whether the conduct was directed at more than one person; (6) whether the conduct arose in the context of other discriminatory conduct; and (7) whether the conduct implicates concerns related to academic freedom or protected speech.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">A single isolated incident may create a hostile environment if the incident is sufficiently severe, particularly if the conduct is physical.&nbsp; A single incident of Sexual Assault, for example, may be sufficiently severe to constitute a hostile environment.&nbsp; In contrast, the perceived offensiveness of a single verbal or written expression is typically not sufficient to constitute a hostile environment, but may still be considered Prohibited Conduct that violates this Policy.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">This Policy is consistent with the College&rsquo;s commitment to academic freedom and free speech.&nbsp; This commitment requires that the College protect community members&rsquo; expression of ideas in their teaching and learning including topics that may be controversial, provocative, or unpopular.&nbsp; This protection extends to the expression of ideas, however controversial, in the classroom, and other campus-related activities.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">It must be recognized, however, that this protection has its limits.&nbsp; This Policy defines those limits, and conduct which is found to be &ldquo;harassing&rdquo; is not consistent with the College&rsquo;s commitment to academic freedom and free speech.&nbsp; No member of the College community may escape responsibility for engaging in harassing conduct merely by labeling the conduct as &ldquo;speech&rdquo; or other expressive activity.</p>

		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>i. Non-Consensual Sexual Penetration<br>

		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">To provide clarity to all individuals as to the kinds of behavior which constitute Sexual Misconduct, the College further defines key terms which the College will use in evaluating whether Prohibited Conduct has occurred.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>i.&nbsp; Affirmative Consent</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&ldquo;Affirmative Consent&rdquo; means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. &nbsp;Affirmative consent is required for any sexual activity to occur between two or more individuals. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that the person has the affirmative consent of the other(s) to engage in the sexual activity.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">It shall not be a valid excuse to alleged lack of affirmative consent that the Respondent believed that the Complainant consented to the sexual activity under either of the following circumstances: (a) The Respondent&rsquo;s belief in affirmative consent arose from the intoxication or recklessness of the Respondent, or (b) the Respondent did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the Respondent at the time, to ascertain whether the Complainant affirmatively consented.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">The following are essential elements of affirmative consent: </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; Informed and reciprocal:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> All Parties must demonstrate a clear and mutual understanding of the nature and scope of the act to which they are consenting and a willingness to do the same thing, at the same time, in the same way. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; Freely and actively given:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Consent cannot be obtained through the use of force, coercion, threats, intimidation or pressuring, or by taking advantage of the incapacitation of another individual. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; Mutually understandable:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Communication regarding consent consists of mutually understandable words and/or actions that indicate a mutually unambiguous willingness to engage in sexual activity. &nbsp;Consent may not be inferred from silence, passivity, lack of resistance, or lack of active response. An individual who does not physically resist or verbally refuse sexual activity is not necessarily giving consent. &nbsp;Relying solely upon non-verbal communication can lead to a false conclusion as to whether consent was sought or given. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; Not indefinite:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout the activity. &nbsp;Consent may be withdrawn by any Party at any time. Recognizing the dynamic nature of sexual activity, individuals choosing to engage in sexual activity must evaluate consent in an ongoing manner and communicate clearly throughout all stages of sexual activity. &nbsp;Withdrawal of consent can be an expressed &ldquo;no&rdquo; or can be based on an outward demonstration that conveys that an individual is hesitant, confused, uncertain, or is no longer a mutual participant. Once consent is withdrawn, the sexual activity must cease immediately and all Parties must obtain mutually expressed or clearly stated consent before continuing further sexual activity. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; Not unlimited:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Consent to one form of sexual contact does not constitute consent to all forms of sexual contact, nor does consent to sexual activity with one person constitute consent to activity with any other person. &nbsp;Each participant in a sexual encounter must consent to each form of sexual contact with each participant. Even in the context of a current or previous intimate relationship, each Party must consent to each instance of sexual contact each time. &nbsp;The consent must be based on mutually understandable communication that clearly indicates a willingness to engage in sexual activity. The mere fact that there has been prior intimacy or sexual activity does not, by itself, imply consent to future acts. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; Age: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">The State of Texas considers sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 17 to be unlawful. &nbsp;A person who engages in &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; sexual intercourse, sexual contact, or indecency with a child as described in the Texas Penal Code does so without effective consent as defined by the College&rsquo;s Sexual Misconduct Policy. &nbsp;Specifically, there is no effective consent under the College&rsquo;s Sexual Misconduct Policy where one Party (the &ldquo;minor&rdquo;) is under the age of seventeen, and the other Party is more than three years older than the minor. Reports received that allege sexual intercourse, sexual contact, or sexual indecency with a person under the age of 17 will be reported to the City of Austin Police Department (or appropriate law enforcement agency if the act occurred outside of the City of Austin) as this conduct could constitute sexual abuse of children.</span></p>
		  <p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 60px"><b><i>ii.&nbsp; Force </i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&ldquo;Force&rdquo; is the use or threat of physical violence to overcome an individual&rsquo;s freedom of will to choose whether or not to participate in sexual activity or provide consent. &nbsp;Consent obtained by force is not valid. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">For the use of force to be demonstrated, there is no requirement that a Complainant resist the sexual advance or request. &nbsp;However, evidence of resistance by the Complainant will be viewed as a clear demonstration of a lack of consent.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>iii.&nbsp; Intimidation</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&ldquo;Intimidation&rdquo; is the use of implied threats to overcome an individual&rsquo;s freedom of will to choose whether or not to participate in sexual activity or provide consent. &nbsp;Consent obtained by intimidation is not valid.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>iv.&nbsp; Coercion</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&ldquo;Coercion&rdquo; is the improper use of pressure to compel another individual to initiate or continue sexual activity against that individual&rsquo;s will. &nbsp;Consent obtained through coercion is not valid.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">Coercion can include a wide range of behaviors, including intimidation, manipulation, threats, and blackmail. &nbsp;A person&rsquo;s words or conduct are sufficient to constitute coercion if they wrongfully impair another individual&rsquo;s freedom of will and ability to choose whether or not to engage in sexual activity. &nbsp;Examples of coercion include threatening to &ldquo;out&rdquo; someone based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression and threatening to harm oneself if the other Party does not engage in the sexual activity. &nbsp;When someone indicates, verbally or physically, that they do not want to engage in a particular sexual activity, that they want to stop a particular activity, or that they do not want to go past a certain point of sexual interaction, continued activity or pressure to continue beyond that point can be coercive. &nbsp;The College will evaluate the following in determining whether coercion was used: (a) the frequency of the application of pressure, (b) the intensity of the pressure, (c) the degree of isolation of the person being pressured, and (4) the duration of the pressure.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>v. Incapacitation</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&ldquo;Incapacitation&rdquo; is a state where an individual cannot make an informed and rational decision to engage in sexual activity because of a lack of conscious understanding of the fact, nature, or extent of the act (e.g., to understand the &ldquo;who, what, when, where, why, or how&rdquo; of the sexual interaction) and/or is physically helpless. &nbsp;For example, an individual is incapacitated, and therefore unable to give consent, if the individual is asleep, unconscious, or otherwise unaware that sexual activity is occurring. An individual will also be considered incapacitated if the person cannot understand the nature of the activity or communicate due to a mental or physical condition. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">Incapacitation may result from the use of alcohol, drugs, or other medication. &nbsp;Consumption of alcohol or other drugs alone is insufficient to establish incapacitation.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">The impact of alcohol and drugs varies from person to person, and evaluating incapacitation requires an assessment of how the consumption of alcohol and/or drugs impacts an individual&rsquo;s: &nbsp;(1) decision-making ability; (2) awareness of consequences; (3) ability to make informed judgments; or (4) capacity to appreciate the nature and the quality of the act.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">It shall not be a valid excuse that the Respondent believed that the Complainant affirmatively consented to the sexual activity if the Respondent knew or reasonably should have known that the Complainant was unable to consent to the sexual activity under any of the following circumstances: (a) the Complainant was asleep or unconscious; (b) the Complainant was incapacitated due to the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication, so that the Complainant could not understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual activity; (c) the Complainant was unable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether the Respondent reasonably should have known that the Complainant was incapacitated will be evaluated using an objective reasonable person standard. &nbsp;The fact that the Respondent was actually unaware of the Complainant&rsquo;s incapacity is irrelevant to this analysis, particularly where the Respondent&rsquo;s failure to appreciate the Complainant&rsquo;s incapacitation resulted from the Respondent&rsquo;s failure to take reasonable steps to determine the Complainant&rsquo;s incapacitation or where the Respondent&rsquo;s own incapacitation (from alcohol or drugs) caused the Respondent to misjudge the Complainant&rsquo;s incapacity.&nbsp;</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">It is the responsibility of each Party to be aware of the intoxication level of the other Party before engaging in sexual activity. &nbsp;In general, sexual activity while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs poses a risk to all Parties. If there is any doubt as to the level or extent of the other individual&rsquo;s intoxication, it is safest to forgo or cease any sexual contact or activity. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">Being intoxicated by drugs or alcohol is no defense to any violation of this Policy and does not diminish one&rsquo;s responsibility to obtain consent. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>vi.&nbsp; Prohibited Relationships by Persons in Authority</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Sexual, romantic, or intimate relationships in which one party engages in a supervisory or evaluative role over the other party are prohibited. In general, this includes all sexual, romantic, or intimate relationships between students and their professors, coaches, advisors, employers, supervisors, or other College employees.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Similarly, College employees (faculty and staff) who supervise or otherwise hold positions of authority over others are prohibited from having a sexual, romantic, or intimate relationship with an individual under the employee&rsquo;s supervision.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Faculty, administrators, and others who educate, supervise, evaluate, employ, counsel, coach, or otherwise guide students should understand the fundamentally asymmetrical nature of the relationship they have with students, employees (as applicable), or subordinates.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Sexual, romantic, or intimate relationships where there is a differential in power or authority produce risks for every member of our community and undermine the professionalism of faculty and employees. In either context, the unequal position of the parties presents an inherent element of risk and may raise sexual harassment concerns if one person in the relationship has the actual or apparent authority to supervise, evaluate, counsel, coach, or otherwise make decisions or recommendations as to the other person in connection with their employment or education at the College.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Sexual relations between persons occupying asymmetrical positions of power, even when both consent, raise suspicions that the person in&nbsp;authority has violated standards of professional conduct and potentially subject the person in authority to charges of sexual harassment based on changes in the perspective of the individuals as to the consensual nature of the relationship. Similarly, these relationships may impact third-parties based on perceived or actual favoritism or special treatment based on the relationship.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Any evidence that demonstrates that a person in a position of authority over another, or in an evaluative role, is engaging in a sexual, romantic, or intimate relationship with someone whom they are teaching, mentoring, evaluating, supervising, counseling, advising, or the like shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this policy regardless of whether the conduct is or continues to be wanted or reciprocated.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Employees who may not have the requisite supervisory or evaluative role over the students, but otherwise provide guidance or direct services to a student while serving in their professional capacity are prohibited from engaging in conduct that displays a sexual, romantic, or intimate relationship with a student they serve while working, regardless of whether the conduct is, or continues to be wanted or reciprocated.&nbsp; Conduct such as this may be addressed through this policy in consultation with the appropriate supervisory personnel, as needed.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Evidence that such prohibited relationships occurred in the past will also be considered prima facie evidence of a violation of this policy.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>vii.&nbsp; Retaliation&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Retaliation includes adverse action taken against a person for making a good faith complaint or report of Prohibited Conduct or participating in any proceeding under this Policy.&nbsp; Adverse action includes conduct that threatens, intimidates, harasses, coerces or in any other way seeks to discourage a reasonable person from engaging in activity protected under this Policy.&nbsp; Retaliation can be committed by or against any individual or group of individuals, not just a Respondent or Complainant.&nbsp; Retaliation does not include good faith actions lawfully pursued in response to a report of Prohibited Conduct.&nbsp; Retaliation may be present even where there is a finding of &ldquo;no responsibility&rdquo; on the allegations of Prohibited Conduct.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The College will take immediate and responsive action to any report of retaliation and will pursue disciplinary action as appropriate.&nbsp; An individual reporting Prohibited Conduct is entitled to protection from any form of retaliation following a report that is made in good faith, even if the report is later not proven.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">As explained below, any employee may pursue any charge of discrimination or harassment with the Texas Workforce Commission (&ldquo;TWC&rdquo;) or the federal Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (&ldquo;EEOC&rdquo;).&nbsp; It is unlawful to retaliate against any employee for opposing the practices prohibited by the State of Texas or comparable federal law or for filing a complaint with, or for otherwise participating in, an investigation, proceeding, or hearing conducted by the TWC or EEOC.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The TWC&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division&rsquo;s programs provide an avenue for current and former employees (or people who applied for employment) to file a complaint if they believe they have been discriminated against in an employment transaction. TWC accepts complaints if you believe the treatment you received from the employer was because of your race, color, national origin, age, religion, sex, disability, or because of retaliation for participating and/or filing another discrimination complaint and occurred within 180 days of the filing of the complaint.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Employees who believe they may have been discriminated against may get more information on filing a complaint through TWC by visiting: <a href="http://www.twc.state.tx.us/jobseekers/how-submit-employment-discrimination-complaint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.twc.state.tx.us/jobseekers/how-submit-employment-discrimination-complaint</a></p>
		  <h4>VI. Reporting Policies and Protocols</h4>
		  <p>The College strongly encourages all individuals to seek assistance from a medical provider and/or law enforcement immediately after an incident of sexual or intimate partner violence.&nbsp; This is the best option to ensure preservation of evidence and to begin a timely investigative and remedial response.</p>
		  <p>The College also strongly encourages all individuals to make a report to the College and to law enforcement, although neither is required.&nbsp; These reporting options are not mutually exclusive.&nbsp; Both internal and criminal reports may be made simultaneously. Reports can also be made anonymously online through a link provided on the College&rsquo;s homepage.</p>
		  <p>The College has a strong interest in supporting victims/survivors of sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and intimate partner violence and strongly encourages all individuals or Third-Parties to report any incident to the College.</p>
		  <p>Making a report means telling a Responsible Employee what happened &mdash; in person, by telephone, in writing, or by email.&nbsp; At the time a report is made, a Complainant does not have to request any particular course of action, nor does a Complainant need to know how to label what happened.&nbsp; Choosing to make a report, and deciding how to proceed after making the report, can be a process that unfolds over time. The College provides support that can assist each individual in making these important decisions, and will respect an individual&rsquo;s autonomy in deciding how to proceed to the extent legally possible.&nbsp; In this process, the College will balance the individual&rsquo;s interest with its obligation to provide a safe and non-discriminatory environment for all members of the College community.</p>
		  <p>The College will investigate and resolve all reports of Prohibited Conduct in a fair and impartial manner.&nbsp; A Complainant, a Respondent and all individuals involved will be treated with dignity and respect.&nbsp; In response to all reports of Prohibited Conduct, the College will make an immediate assessment of any risk of harm to the Complainant, Respondent, or to the broader campus community and will take steps necessary to address those risks.&nbsp; These steps may include interim measures to provide for the safety of the individual and the campus community.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>A.&nbsp; &nbsp;Amnesty for Alcohol or Other Drug Use or Other Conduct Violations </strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The College strongly encourages the reporting of Prohibited Conduct under this Policy.&nbsp; It is in the best interest of this community that as many Complainants as possible choose to report to college officials and that participants in the investigation process are forthright in sharing information.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">To guard against discouraging reporting, a student who reports Prohibited Conduct in good faith, either as a victim or a witness, will not be subject to disciplinary action by the College for personal consumption or possession of alcohol<sup>7 </sup> or drugs or other violations of the student standards of conduct policy (not including this Policy) at or near the time of the incident. The College may investigate to determine whether a report of Prohibited Conduct outlined in this policy was made in good faith.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The College may always initiate an educational discussion or pursue other educational remedies with the student regarding alcohol or other drugs.&nbsp; Being intoxicated by drugs or alcohol is no defense to any violation of this Policy and does not diminish one&rsquo;s responsibility to obtain consent.</p>

		  <hr>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>B.&nbsp; &nbsp;Coordination with Law Enforcement </strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The College strongly encourages Complainants to pursue criminal action for incidents of sexual harassment, sexual violence, and intimate partner violence that may also be crimes under Texas law.&nbsp; The Title IX Team will assist a Complainant in making a criminal report with law enforcement agencies if a Complainant decides to pursue the criminal process to the extent permitted by law.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The College&rsquo;s Policy, definitions, and burden of proof differ from Texas criminal law.&nbsp; A Complainant may seek recourse under this Policy and/or pursue criminal action.&nbsp; Neither law enforcement&rsquo;s determination whether or not to prosecute a Respondent, nor the outcome of any criminal prosecution, are determinative of whether a violation of this Policy has occurred.&nbsp; Proceedings under this Policy may be carried out prior to, simultaneously with, or following civil or criminal proceedings off campus.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The College may not delay conducting its own investigation unless specifically requested by law enforcement. In the event of such specific request, the College shall defer its investigation only during the time that law enforcement is conducting preliminary fact-finding, which should not exceed ten (10) business days absent extenuating circumstances. The College will nevertheless communicate with the Complainant and Respondent (if appropriate) regarding Title IX rights, procedural options, and the implementation of interim measures to assure safety and well-being.&nbsp; The College will promptly resume fact-gathering as soon as it is informed that law enforcement has completed its initial investigation.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>C.&nbsp; &nbsp;False Reports </strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">The College takes the accuracy of information very seriously, as a report of Prohibited Conduct may have severe consequences. &nbsp;A good-faith complaint that results in a finding of not responsible is not considered a false or fabricated report of Prohibited Conduct. &nbsp;However, when a Complainant or Third-Party witness is found to have fabricated allegations or given false information with malicious intent or in bad faith, the Complainant may be subject to disciplinary action. &nbsp;It is a violation of the Code of Student Conduct to make an intentionally false report of any Policy violation, and it may also violate state criminal statutes and civil defamation laws. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>D.&nbsp; &nbsp;Reports Involving Minors or Suspected Child Abuse </strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Under Texas law, an individual must make a mandatory report of suspected child abuse and neglect, including sexual assault when that individual, in their professional capacity or within the scope of their employment, has knowledge of, or observes, a minor under the age of 18 whom the individual knows or reasonably suspects has been the survivor of child abuse or neglect.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">All College employees are required to immediately report any suspected child abuse and neglect to the District Title IX Coordinator and the Chief of the ACC District Police.&nbsp; The source of abuse does not need to be known in order to file a report.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The College will report all suspected child abuse and neglect, including sexual assault, to law enforcement and/or the Texas Child Protective Services.&nbsp; The College must act quickly regarding all reasonable suspicions of sexual or physical abuse.&nbsp; It is not the responsibility of any employee, student, or volunteer to investigate suspected child abuse.&nbsp; This is the role of Child Protective Services and law enforcement authorities.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">In addition to notifying the District Title IX Coordinator and Chief of the ACC District Police, any individual may make a direct report as follows:</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; If a child is in immediate danger, call 911.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; If there is no immediate danger, contact the Texas Child Protective Services by calling 1-800-252-5400.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>E.&nbsp; &nbsp;Investigation Procedures</strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>i.&nbsp; Modification of Investigation Process</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">The College will follow the Investigation Process described herein barring exceptional circumstances. &nbsp;In rare instances, however, the College may be required to adapt or modify the Investigation Process (including timelines) to ensure prompt and equitable resolution of a report of Prohibited Conduct. &nbsp;The College reserves this right. In such instances, the College will notify both Parties of the modification of the Investigation Process and, if appropriate, the exceptional circumstances requiring the College to adapt or modify the Investigation Process.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>ii.&nbsp; Consolidation of Investigations</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">The District Title IX Coordinator has the discretion to consolidate into one Investigation multiple reports against a Respondent and/or cross-complaints between a Complainant and a Respondent, if the evidence related to each incident would be relevant and probative in reaching a determination on the other incident. &nbsp;Matters may be consolidated where they involve multiple Complainants, multiple Respondents, or related conduct that would regularly have been heard under the Student Standards of Conduct investigation and disciplinary process. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>iii.&nbsp; Integrity of Proceeding</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">These procedures are entirely administrative in nature and are not considered legal proceedings, but rather procedures designed to address policy violations.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">While either Party may bring a legal representative or other advisor to the proceeding, the role of the lawyer or advisor is limited to providing advice and counsel to that Party. &nbsp;The lawyer or other advisor is not permitted to speak on behalf of the Party, to make arguments to the tribunal, to cross-examine individuals, or otherwise to act in a representational capacity or as a proxy for the Party.&nbsp; If a Party intends to bring a lawyer or advisor, they are to provide notice of this decision in writing no less than 3 days before the proceeding. The process will not be delayed due to the unavailability of an advisor or lawyer.&nbsp; An advisor or lawyer may be dismissed from any part of this process for unnecessary disruption of a meeting or proceeding or if they are deemed to have intimidated or otherwise harassed a Party through verbal, nonverbal, or physical actions.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">The College reserves the right to serve as a Complainant in any complaint and to bring complaints against a Respondent(s). &nbsp;This is unusual but can occur when the College feels there is sufficient information to proceed, but an actual Complainant either cannot or will not cooperate in this process.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><b><i>iv.&nbsp; Initial Report, Preliminary Inquiry, and Determination of Jurisdiction</i></b></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; Upon receiving a report (either verbally or in writing) of a potential violation of this Policy, the District Title IX Coordinator will assess the report independently, or in concert with the appropriate Deputy Title IX Coordinator(s), Responsible Employee, or Third Party (depending on who the report was made to and depending on the facts and circumstances being alleged). &nbsp;</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; If necessary, the District Title IX Coordinator may conduct a preliminary inquiry to gather information to determine if this Policy has jurisdiction over the alleged prohibited conduct reported. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; To ensure ACC community members are safe and are able to continue in their educational programs or employment, a preliminary inquiry<sup>8</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> may be necessary under the following circumstances:</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 90px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; A report received from a Third Party does not include enough information to proceed with an investigation, such as the identity of the parties or witnesses, but the report alleges prohibited conduct.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 90px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; A Complainant makes a report but does not want the College to take any action after reporting or requests confidentiality. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; In response to the receipt of an anonymous report.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; If the District Title IX Coordinator determines that this Policy has jurisdiction over the conduct being alleged, the District Coordinator will inform the appropriate Deputy Coordinator about the case.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; The District Title IX Coordinator will provide the Complainant with a &ldquo;Written Notice of Rights &amp; Options&rdquo; in response to any alleged conduct that includes dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; The District Title IX Coordinator will assess any immediate safety concerns, need for medical attention, and interim protective measures the Complainant may require based on the report. &nbsp;The District Title IX Coordinator will discuss these with the Complainant, preferably in person depending on the Complainant&rsquo;s availability. The District Title IX Coordinator will implement such protective measures in concert with appropriate resources and stakeholders.</span></p>

If an employee is the Respondent, confidential information may also be disclosed with appropriate personnel by the investigator assigned or member of the Title IX team. </span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; The District Title IX Coordinator will meet separately with the Parties if possible to provide written notice &nbsp;that an investigation will ensue. Both Parties will receive a copy of this Policy and will be advised on the offense being alleged, the date and time that the incident is alleged to have occurred, and the name of the Investigator (if known at that time.) &nbsp;The Parties will also be provided with information on all on and off campus resources available to support them through the process as well as their right to have an advisor of choice<sup>9</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> accompany them to any meeting or disciplinary proceeding in which they are required to be present. &nbsp;The letter will outline the major timeframes of the process and explain where the Parties are in the process currently.

		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; A written complaint is not required when reporting alleged Sexual Misconduct. Should a Complainant submit a written complaint, the Respondent will be provided with a copy to review. The Complainant will be informed that this information will be shared. If a report<sup>10</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> of alleged sexual misconduct is received verbally, the District Title IX Coordinator will reduce to writing a summary of the allegations and provide them to the Respondent prior to the initial interview of the allegations.</span></p>

		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; The Investigator will conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into the facts of the case and additionally interview any witnesses relevant to the fact-finding and inspect and collect evidence submitted or uncovered. &nbsp;Mere character witnesses are not considered witnesses that have information related to the allegation and will not be interviewed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> &nbsp;</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; If the investigation is conducted by an outside person, the District Title IX Coordinator shall provide the investigator with any relevant ACC policies and procedures or any materials that the investigator will need to conduct a thorough investigation.</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">&bull;&nbsp; If, during the course of the investigation, other violations of ACC policies or procedures or statutes are discovered, the violations should be communicated to the District Title IX Coordinator. &nbsp;The District Title IX Coordinator will consult with the appropriate College personnel to determine the best course of action to respond to such violations.&nbsp;This may include management of those violations in accordance with the related policies and procedures, or the District Title IX Coordinator will address such violations in this process subject to the approval of the appropriate personnel with the requisite authority.&nbsp; An individual will be provided with the required amount of due process afforded to them depending on the facts and circumstances of the violation and corresponding sanctions, if applicable.&nbsp; Sanctions issued for these violations may be issued within this process, as well as appealed in accordance with the provisions outlined in Section F.</span></p>

		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>F.&nbsp; &nbsp;Appeals </strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">All determinations, including &ldquo;not responsible findings&rdquo;, may be appealed to an Appeal Panel of three ACC administrators who will be appointed by the Vice President, Student Services to consider the appeal. For purposes of the appellate panel, ACC administrator is defined as Executive Director, Dean, Executive Dean, Associate Vice President, or Vice President. Either Party may file a request for appeal in writing. The appeal should state reasons and grounds for the appeal.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Appeals are not heard in person; instead all requests for appeal must be submitted in writing to the Vice President, Student Services within five (5) business days from the date on the letter notifying the Respondent or the Complainant of the original finding. Failure to appeal within the allotted time will render the original finding final.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Appeals shall be granted only on one or more of the following grounds:</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">1. If there was a specified procedural error (or errors) in the interpretation of the College regulations that were so substantial as to effectively deny the party appealing a fair investigation or resolution process;</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">2. If new and significant evidence has become available which could not have been discovered by a properly diligent person during the original investigation; or</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">3. If the sanction(s) is/are disproportionate to the offense for which the respondent was found responsible.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The Vice President, Student Services will forward the written request for the appeal to the Appeal Panel. The non-appealing party will be notified of the request for appeal.&nbsp; A written response may be voluntarily submitted to the Appeal Panel by the non-appealing party to the issues raised in the written request for an appeal, or the Appeal Panel may request such a response. At this time, the parties may also submit impact/mitigation statements to the Appeals Panel for review and consideration. The Appeals Panel shall review the record of the final report, the written request for appeal, the non appealing parties written response to the request for appeal if submitted, and any submitted impact/mitigation statements to determine if grounds for an appeal are met. &nbsp;The fact that one of the parties disagrees with the finding or sanction does not in and of itself constitute grounds for appeal. If the Appeal Panel finds no grounds for an appeal, then the decision will become final. There is no further appeal within the College.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">If the Appeal Panel finds grounds for appeal, shall consider the issues raised and information presented in the appeal.&nbsp; The Appeal Panel has authority to dismiss the case, change the sanction, modify the findings, or uphold the findings and sanctions.&nbsp; The appeal panel must base its decision on the information presented in the appeal and a review of the record in the case.&nbsp; The scope of the Appeal Panel&rsquo;s review is limited to the grounds for appeal identified in the appeal letter. The Appeal Panel shall send written final decision to the Vice President, Student Services and the District Title IX Coordinator.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The decision of the Appeal Panel is final and there is no further appeal within the College. The District Title IX Coordinator will communicate decisions regarding the appeal to the Complainant and Respondent simultaneously via College email and U.S. Mail.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The imposition of sanctions is not normally deferred during the appeal process and sanctions may go into effect immediately if the District Title IX Coordinator deems it necessary. Interim measures will remain in place during the appeal process.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>G.&nbsp; Exceptions to Formal Resolution</strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="font-weight: 400">At the discretion of the District Title IX Coordinator, the following exceptions may apply to proceeding with Formal Resolution:</span></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">1.&nbsp; If the College lacks jurisdiction over a party to the complaint;</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">2.&nbsp; If the report is being addressed through Informal Resolution;</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">3.&nbsp; If a Complainant stops participating in either the Formal or Informal Resolution process, the College will either serve as the Complainant moving forward or the District Title IX Coordinator will resolve the complaint, if appropriate, and modify procedures where necessary;</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">4. If a Respondent admits responsibility for the alleged conduct, the District Title IX Coordinator shall have discretion to resolve the complaint outside the Formal Resolution process or to provide modified procedures and appropriate sanctions/remedies to prevent the reoccurrence of the conduct. This includes reports of consensual prohibited relationships that violate this Policy; or</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">5. If a complaint of alleged prohibited conduct is made by a Third Party, and the alleged victim(s) does not wish to participate, does not want the College take any action, or wants to remain confidential, the District Title IX Coordinator shall have the discretion to resolve the complaint outside the Formal Resolution process or modify procedures, if appropriate and this does not result in a violation of a Respondent&rsquo;s due process rights.&nbsp; The College also has the option of serving as the Complainant if deemed necessary.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>H.&nbsp; Informal Resolution </strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">As an alternative to Formal Resolution, and only if the District Title IX Coordinator determines that it is appropriate, the Parties may choose to resolve complaints through Informal Resolution.&nbsp; Informal Resolution may be appropriate for alleged conduct that has not created a hostile environment or deprived an individual of participation in the College&rsquo;s educational programming or employment.&nbsp; Less serious, yet inappropriate behaviors can be addressed through informal resolution as an alternative to formal resolution.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The Parties may proceed to Informal Resolution only if the following occurs:&nbsp; first, the District Title IX Coordinator determines that the complaint may be resolved appropriately through Informal Resolution; second, the Complainant agrees to Informal Resolution; and third, the Respondent agrees to Informal Resolution.&nbsp; If any of the three conditions is not met, the case will proceed to Formal Resolution.&nbsp; If all three conditions are met, the District Title IX Coordinator will notify the Parties within five (5) business days after all parties have agreed to Informal Resolution, and proceed through the Informal Resolution Process.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The nature of Informal Resolution is flexible, and not all complaints resolved through Informal Resolution will proceed in uniform fashion.&nbsp; Typically, however, the District Title IX Coordinator will ask the Complainant to prepare a written report, which sets out the factual basis for the complaint and any proposed resolution.&nbsp; The Complainant will be asked to provide the written report to the District Title IX Coordinator within five (5) business days of conclusion of the initial meeting between the Complainant and the District Title IX Coordinator.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The District Title IX Coordinator will share the Complainant&rsquo;s written report with the Respondent, and will ask the Respondent to provide a written response to the report within five (5) business days of reviewing the Complainant&rsquo;s report.&nbsp; The District Title IX Coordinator will then meet separately or together with both Parties to discuss potential alternative resolutions based on the Parties&rsquo; statements and (if applicable) other information available.&nbsp; The District Title IX Coordinator will not serve as a fact finder, but rather, aid in identifying possible alternative resolution(s) to the complaint.&nbsp; Possible alternative resolution(s) may include, but are not limited to:</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; Permanent no-contact order between the Parties</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; Specific personal boundaries if a no-contact order is unwanted by both parties</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; Academic or work location reassignment</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; Written apology and/or explanation of the circumstances surrounding the investigation</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; Verbal apology</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; Educational remedies</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; Return personal belongings</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; Agreed upon sanctions or remedial measures</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">&bull;&nbsp; Other appropriate measures</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">If the Parties reach agreement, the matter is closed.&nbsp; If not, the Formal Resolution will commence, provided that none of the exceptions to Formal Resolution outlined in Section G above are applicable.&nbsp; Any Party (including the District Title IX Coordinator) may terminate the Informal Resolution process at any time.&nbsp; In that event, the District Title IX Coordinator will so notify the Parties in writing and will describe the next steps to resolve the report.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>I.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sanctions &amp; Remedial Measures</strong></p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">If the report proceeds through Formal Resolution and the Respondent is found responsible for one or more violations of this policy, the College will issue sanctions commensurate with the violation(s).&nbsp; Sanctions may also be issued if agreed upon during Informal Resolution.&nbsp; Absent a finding of responsibility, remedial and protective measures may be issued if warranted to address inappropriate behavior that does not rise to the level of a violation of this Policy. Remedial measures may include counseling, monitoring, training or other preventative measures intended to educate an individual as to appropriate behaviors and boundaries. If during an investigation under this Policy, conduct is found to be in violation of other ACC policies or procedures or statutes, sanctions may be issued within this process after consultation with the appropriate personnel with the requisite authority.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">The District Title IX Coordinator will determine and issue any sanctions and permanent protective measures for students who are found responsible for a violation(s) of this Policy.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">A variety of sanctions consistent with the Sanctioning Guidelines may be employed.&nbsp; Sanctions may deviate from the guidelines on a case-by-case basis when circumstances merit deviation.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Sanctions are effective immediately.&nbsp; If the Respondent appeals the findings contained in the Final Report, the sanctions will continue in effect during the appeal.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">If the Respondent is an employee, the Deputy Title IX Coordinator for Human Resources, along with the District Title IX Coordinator, will determine sanctions if misconduct as defined by this policy is found to have occurred, or if the conduct violates another ACC policy.&nbsp; Possible sanctions for employees are set forth in Administrative Rule (AR) 6.08.003 and the Guidelines/Procedures for AR 6.08.003. &nbsp;&nbsp;A sanction resulting in a recommendation for termination of employment shall be made in accordance with applicable Board Policy and College policies and rules.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">Possible sanctions for students include, but are not limited to:</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">1.&nbsp; <strong>Warning</strong>:&nbsp; Notice, in writing, that continuation or repetition of Prohibited Conduct may be cause for additional disciplinary action.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">2.&nbsp; <strong>Censure</strong>:&nbsp; A written reprimand for violating the Sexual Misconduct Policy.&nbsp; This conduct status specifies a period of time during which the student&rsquo;s good standing with the College may be in jeopardy.&nbsp; The student is officially warned that continuation or repetition of Prohibited Conduct may be cause for additional conduct action including probation, suspension, or expulsion from the College.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">3.&nbsp; <strong>Disciplinary Probation</strong>:&nbsp; Exclusion from participation in privileged activities for a specified period of time (privileged activities may include, but are not limited to, elected or appointed offices, student research, clubs/student organizations, intramural sports and recreation, study abroad, and some student employment).&nbsp; Additional restrictions or conditions may also be imposed.&nbsp; Violations of the terms of disciplinary probation or any other College policy violations may result in further disciplinary action.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">4.&nbsp; <strong>Restitution</strong>:&nbsp; Repayment to the College or to an affected Party for damages (amount to be determined by the College) resulting from a violation of this Policy.&nbsp; To enforce this sanction, the College reserves the right to withhold its transcripts and degrees or to deny a student participation in graduation ceremonies and privileged events.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">5.&nbsp; <strong>Suspension</strong>:&nbsp; Exclusion from College premises, attending classes, and other privileges or activities for a specified period of time, as set forth in the suspension notice.&nbsp; Conditions for readmission may be specified in the suspension notice.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">6.&nbsp; <strong>Expulsion</strong>:&nbsp; Permanent termination of student status and exclusion from College premises, privileges, and activities.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">7.&nbsp; <strong>Criminal Trespass Warning</strong>:&nbsp; If appropriate, students and employees may be prohibited from entering any ACC campus or property.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">8.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Revocation of Admission and/or Degree/Certificate/Award</strong>:&nbsp; Admission to, or a degree/certificate/award issued by, the College may be revoked for violating this Policy, or for other serious violations of any other College Policy found to be committed by a student during an investigation under this Policy.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">9.&nbsp; <strong>Withholding Degree/Certificate/Award</strong>:&nbsp; The College may withhold awarding a degree/certificate/award otherwise earned until the completion of the process set forth in this Policy, including the completion of all sanctions imposed, if any.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">10.&nbsp; <strong>Other:</strong>&nbsp; Other sanctions may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, those specified here.&nbsp; Sanctions may include remedial measures. Service, education or research projects may also be assigned.</p>
		  <p style="padding-left: 60px">11.&nbsp; <strong>Multiple Sanctions</strong>:&nbsp; More than one of the sanctions listed above may be imposed for any single violation.</p>
		  <h4>VII.&nbsp; Records</h4>
		  <p>The Title IX Office will retain records related to the investigation and resolution of reports of Prohibited Conduct for seven (7) years. Affirmative findings of responsibility in matters resolved through Formal Resolution are part of a student&rsquo;s conduct record and an employee&rsquo;s employment file.&nbsp; Such records shall be used in reviewing any further conduct, or developing sanctions, and shall remain a part of a formal record. Discipline resulting in expulsion or extended suspension shall be maintained permanently in a student&rsquo;s record.</p>
		  <h4>VIII.&nbsp; Prevention and Education</h4>
		  <p>The College is committed to the prevention of Prohibited Conduct through regular and ongoing education and awareness programs.&nbsp; Incoming students and new employees receive primary prevention and awareness programming as part of their orientation, and returning students and current employees receive ongoing training and related education.&nbsp; Visit the Office of Student Life for information about bystander intervention programs and other educational opportunities related to preventing sexual violence at ACC: <a href="https://sites.austincc.edu/sl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sites.austincc.edu/sl/</a></p>

		  <h4>Course Equivalency Guides</h4>
		  <p>Course equivalency guides show a list of equivalent courses that transfer from ACC to various colleges and universities. Some equivalency guides are specific to ACC courses, while others show equivalencies to Texas Common Course Numbers (TCCN).

		  <h4>Transfer Credit Limitations</h4>
		  <p>Many ACC courses transfer to other colleges and universities. However, a transferred course may not always apply toward your degree at the transfer college or university. Consult an advisor at the destination college to learn which specific courses will transfer to your intended major.</p>
		  <p>According to <a href="http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board</a> rules, no institution of higher education is required to accept in transfer, or apply toward a degree program, more than 60 semester credit hours of lower-division academic credit.&nbsp;Some colleges or universities may choose to accept additional credit hours.</p>
		  <h4>Transfer Dispute Resolution</h4>
		  <p>ACC works closely with other colleges and universities to provide a smooth transfer experience for ACC students. The college follows the guidelines established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board for resolving transfer disputes as prescribed by Coordinating Board Rules and Regulations, Chapter 4, Subchapter B, Section 4.27. An ACC vice president accepts the initial contact from a receiving institution when a student transferring from ACC is denied transfer of course credits.</p>
		  <h4>Reverse Transfer</h4>
		  <p>Reverse transfer is a process where credits you earn at a four-year college or university after transferring from Austin Community College are transferred back to ACC to determine if you are eligible for an associate degree. You can apply to the ACC Admissions and Records Office for reverse transfer, or you can provide a release to your four-year university to send your transcript back to ACC.
